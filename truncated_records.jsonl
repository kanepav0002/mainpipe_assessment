{"text": "This really was an unexpected pleasure. When I started reading, my mental picture of Brazil could not have been more different than what I found in this amazing story. Descriptions of the northern countryside, a hot, dry scrub land, contrast wonderfully with the lush humidity of the regional capital of Recife and parallel the storylines of two sisters separated by unusual circumstances. Both girls raised and trained as seamstresses by their widowed aunt, are eventually drawn in completely different directions. The younger sister Luzia’s story of extreme physical hardship and love within a band of roaming outlaws really captured my imagination. I was fascinated reading about a group of people living outdoors, completely at the mercy of the elements and the violent struggles that accompany that choice. Eliza’s life in the city becomes dominated by politics inside and outside her home.\nI really enjoyed this work of historical fiction, learning more about Brazil during the 1920’s and 30’s. The characters were well drawn and threaded throughout the story are metaphors which connect Aunt Sofia’s sewing wisdom with lessons about life and human nature.\nFor me this book contained the perfect blend of landscapes, culture, relationships, family, politics and history.", "url": "http://leekat.booklikes.com/post/608842/an-unexpected-take-on-brazil"}

{"text": "Patient engagement in the design and delivery of virtual health services is critical for success. Get inspired – in this panel session, you’ll learn about how three very different virtual care initiatives involved patients in their design, the lessons learned, and the results that followed.\nFirst, Mathieu Jackson will present the importance for patients to lead self and take responsibility for their own performance and health, through his own experience with virtual health as a hemophilia patient as well as his patient society’s (Canadian Hemophilia Society) involvement in the design and development of the Hemophilia management MyCBDR mobile application, used by close to 1,000 patients across Canada.\nSecond, Dr. Laura Copeland will speak to the leader’s duty and privilege to develop coalitions by harnessing patient partnerships and networks to create results. She spearheaded the introduction of patient participation to physician documentation standards at Humber River Hospital to facilitate the evolution of patient portals with immediate availability of all results and documentation to patients. Now as a Chief Medical Information Officer at Healthtech, interacting with Canada-wide health technology systems, she flags building connections, trust and shared meaning with patients as an essential determinant to successful virtual health service delivery.\nThird, Amy Pack will translate the importance of patient partnerships in the governance of virtual health service delivery. By shedding light on HSO’s people-powered approach to developing standards, she hopes to champion systems transformation by unleashing the potential of patient involvement in the assessment of the safety, quality, and efficacy of virtual health services around the world.\nThrough these three topics and a panel discussion, attendees will gain insights on the undeniable value-add of involving patients in the conception and delivery of virtual health services, inspiring healthcare leaders from around the world to implement systematic change in the way they engage with patients.\nVirtual Health has become an increasingly valuable and viable method of health service delivery, communication, information transfer, and education. It aims to support patient care and provide second opinions and consultation to individuals living in remote and isolated areas where access to healthcare is limited, as well as in urban settings. Removing the in-person interaction in the consultation creates a heightened duty for healthcare leaders to find innovative ways to involve patients in their virtual treatment plan. Effective partnerships with patients and families to accelerate patient safety, quality and health service planning in virtual health are being recognized as a best practice. As a result, new organizational initiatives, standards, policies, evidence and resources are being routinely developed across Canada and internationally. This panel will unravel the patient’s role in virtual health through the perspective of the patient, the provider and the health sciences specialist.", "url": "http://www.nhlc-cnls.ca/sessions/3/"}

{"text": "Food waste is a messy subject. What can one person’s efforts to record her scraps teach us about reducing our footprint?\nLogi, a mythological Nordic warrior, won an medieval eating contest that involved consuming a tray of meat and bones — and the tray itself. (The tray was made of bread in those days, so it’s not such a big deal as it appears.) His gluttonous display was typical of the way men proved they were, indeed, men. The more food consumed, the more powerful the man.\nFor centuries, now, eating enormous quantities of food has been as necessary among the elite — who use consumption as a marker of social status — as it has been among the poor, who never know when the next famine will occur. The abundance or scarcity of food is one of the world’s paradoxes. We eat a lot, though not quite like Nordic warriors. And at the same time, we waste a lot.\nFood waste tops the list of concerns for food system reformers these days. And why not? The UN Food and Agriculture Organization claims that we waste about 1.3 billion tons per year of edible parts of food, or about 4o percent of the food we produce. That’s enough to motivate anyone to reconsider what goes into the trash bin after a meal. The 2013 FAO report, “Food Wastage Footprint, Impacts On Natural Resources,” dissects the mountain of food waste generated each year. Perishable fruits and vegetables occupy much of that mountain for obvious reasons. In spite of advances in food preservation, we haven’t yet found the right technology for eliminating perishability.\nBut before wringing our hands, we should wonder about what constitutes “food wastage,” as the FAO calls food waste. We hear about food waste in the media and at events that reference the same FAO report. As much a consequence of recirculating Internet data, this reliance on a single source can’t be our only source for the war on waste. If the topic is so fundamental to improving our food system, should we be evaluating a range of studies from multiple perspectives? Even without reading the UN report, we might wonder about packaging and about all the leaks along the food supply chain where food becomes waste. Did the FAO really go to a significant number of landfills and weigh all the different types of waste? Might there be other methods for finding food leaks and breaks the food distribution system?\nThe whole topic is messy. But even without knowing the exact amount of food waste in our food system, I imagine we’d all agree that the problem could use a big solution.\nBut overwhelming problems often numb our ability to act individually. Wondering what just one person might contribute to heap of wasted resources, I spent a week photographing my food wastage footprint. I became so self-conscious about my food waste that I began eating more trimmings and food before taking a photo, simply because I was embarrassed by the amount of waste that was about to become public record. Being shunned by one’s peers because of an oversized waste footprint could become the next neurosis requiring treatment by modern psychiatrists.\nWhile I worked to overcome the fear of disapproval, I saw that my food waste footprint had grown to the size of Sasquatch by the end of the week. This wasn’t a complete surprise, since the amount of food that I was required to buy in the grocery store was more than one person could eat in a week; remains of a head of lettuce and a quart of milk were all spoiled by the end of the week. Perhaps this is an admonition to never eat alone. More fun and less waste.\nWhile my experiment wasn’t life-transforming, taking the photos did tell an interesting micro-story about one person’s waste footprint.\nI wonder if there is a better way for single people to buy and prepare food. Would more single-serving packaging alleviate the problem? Lately I’ve noticed “Ready to Serve Brown and Wild Rice” from Riviana Foods in packages of two servings, ready to microwave. It might help, but packaging still needs a solution: even my single-serving yogurt leaves me with a foil top and plastic container at the end of the snack.\nWould growing my own food lessen the amount of waste, since I could pick just what I needed for a meal and compost the remains each day? Maybe, but that would require a lifestyle change for many of us.\nHow about portion controls? When I ate out, the waste trail increased. Restaurants, unless you eat exclusively at over-priced, small-plate restaurants, typically serve more than you can eat. In my case, a sandwich was served with a side of coleslaw, which I don’t eat and didn’t see on the menu.\nWhile my micro-experiment was both fun and enlightening, the exercise missed some of the bigger-picture considerations. How can we see beyond the FAO report? Bjorn Lomborg joins the United Nations Food and Agriculture to emphasize the amount of food wasted in the global food system. Lomborg moves beyond the statistic to consider systemic solutions, such as the need for improvements in our global transportation infrastructure. Ronald Bailey’s book The End of Doom points out that we have a highly productive food system that will produce enough food in the future. There’s enough food, it seems, just in the wrong places.\nSo how do we get all the food to all the right places in the right condition: unspoiled, nutritious and tasty? We could use a focused, concerted effort to address distribution and minimize food left in the field, on the loading dock and in the waste bins of food processors. Those efforts include new packaging, tracking and transport technologies. Everyone, from chefs to consumers, needs a behavior-changing incentive to prepare, serve and consume food in smaller quantities. The move toward selling food in smaller-portioned packages is just a small step in that direction.\nThese innovations, many of them in the works now, will do much more to lower the amount of food waste than anything revealed in my photos. But, hey, try it yourself. Take your cellphone and snap a few post-meal images of your food trail. What do you see?\nShare your food images — and any lessons you learned — using the hashtag #myfoodwaste!", "url": "https://foodandcity.org/waste-not/"}

{"text": "​ Thank You to Director, Joanne Vitale!!!!\nCadette Troop #5203 and Troop #37 from St. Teresa!\nOur Boy & Girl Scouts from St. Teresa are building Emma's Place a Playroom!\nOne of the first things you recognize when you work with grieving children is that there are no “kid-sized” emotions. Any child old enough to love is old enough to grieve. What they lack is the vocabulary to explain what they are feeling in a way adults can understand. Children grieve in a manner and time that is most appropriate for them, and is typically out of sync with where adults are in their grief. Children can grieve intermittently for many years. Depending on their age, children may not manifest grief symptoms until years after a loss. When children’s grief symptoms do occur, many are behavioral. They may become aggressive or withdrawn; overly dependent and clingy; or mischievous and irritable. Grades may plummet or favorite activities may no longer hold their interest. This can happen immediately after or several months or years after a loss. This can be especially prevalent during the holidays when nothing feels right without their loved one and everyone’s emotions are heightened. Children are as worried about you as you are about them. They bear witness to all the intense emotions grief brings to the adults in their lives and do not want to add to the sadness. They might make sure not to talk about the deceased in front of you, and may be the one holding your hand or being strong. This does not mean they are not grieving. Many will cry in private or turn to other means of expression to work through their emotions such as writing, art, or play. These can be wonderful ways to connect with your child and share memories – make an ornament in honor of your loved one; write a holiday card for them or involve the child in creating new traditions that include the memory of their loved one. The most important thing is to keep communication open but this can be more difficult than imagined. As adults we rarely know what to say to other grieving adults, and it is far worse when adults are trying to talk to children. Mostly, children want life to get back to normal and their reactions reflect this desire. Despite their different levels of understanding and unique reactions and coping skills, that children display at different ages, the best way to help a grieving child is to be there, and to know how it feels to lose someone or something you love and to recognize that in them. There is no greater honor than being entrusted with a child’s story, for they do not give it lightly. When you can spare a few extra moments, or stop and answer the myriad of questions, or stand steadfast through the flood of emotions, you provide a voice to a population that we often fail to listen to as closely as we should. For with every little hand held, or tear dried, a difference is made. The smallest gestures mean the world to a grieving child. To be seen and recognized as a mourner is a powerful, life changing event.\n\"Loss makes artists of us all as we weave new patterns in the fabric of our lives.\"", "url": "http://www.emmasplacesi.com/sigc-news.html"}

{"text": "With Irma churning in the Atlantic, it looks like a hit on Florida is a given which means now is a great time to learn how to file a hurricane claim Delray Beach FL style. The first step is always to know exactly what your coverage is – keeping in mind that flooding is not covered under a homeowners’ policy but rather through separate flood insurance purchased through the National Flood Insurance Program. Your insurance policy documents are as important as birth certificates, car titles, deeds, and other documents that are essential to establishing your identity and/or ownership of property. Of course, during the storm, the number one priority is safety.\nAfter the storm, your first call is to your insurance company. The adjuster will walk through how to file a hurricane claim Delray Beach FL homeowners can rely on. Once you’ve made the first call, document as much of the damage as possible, while remaining safe and avoiding downed power lines and other hazards. Consider taking video as well since pictures may not provide the full picture of the scope of the damage. Make necessary repairs to prevent further damage, if necessary, and if the structure is inhabitable, be sure to give the adjustor your new temporary address.\nWhile you are learning how to file a hurricane claim Delray Beach FL style, keep in mind that you will likely have a special and separate “hurricane deductible” which can range from two to 10 percent of the insured value of your home. No matter the amount of the deductible, it is solely your responsibility. And, remember that insurance companies do not typically pay for debris removal that is on your property that does not cause damage.\nAt the same time that you are working with the insurance company, you should also keep your attorney apprised of the status of your claim, particularly if your insurance company is slow to act, defers payments, or is otherwise being unreasonably difficult. Of course, document, document, document all interactions with your insurance company as well as possible, down to times and dates when you speak to agents or adjusters.\nA claims attorney is also a great source of information on how to file a hurricane claim Delray Beach FL homeowners can use to realize the best return. The attorney can advise you on steps to take when dealing with the insurance company and if necessary, can go to bat in negotiating a good settlement of your claim when the time comes.", "url": "https://luckmanlaw.com/file-hurricane-claim-delray-beach-fl.html"}
{"text": "Shape of the World is Stu Maxwell’s passion project. In development since early last year, Maxwell launched a Kickstarter campaign at the beginning of the summer asking for $75,000 to help finish the game. For an entire month he and his wife, Heather, the game’s producer, spent all of their energy promoting it. “I felt like, regardless of funding, I was going to find a way to make this game,” Maxwell told me. The game would have been smaller, and taken longer to come out, but he was going to finish it, even if it meant dipping back into his personal savings.\nBut on June 28th the project met its funding goal, hitting $79,368 a few days later when the campaign ended. Since then the game’s creative team, Hollow Tree Games, which also includes procedural animation specialist Athomas Goldberg and sound artist Brent Silk, has been mapping out the next phase of development.\nDespite the evocative minimalism of the game’s visual style, its lush transformations and naturalistic flow, breaking the mold of the modern objective-based sandbox game isn’t easy. When I asked about how people who have tried the game sometimes react, Maxwell explained that “OK, but what do you DO?” was a common refrain from people interested in the more competitive aspects of videogames.\nRecently, Hollow Tree Games joined the Playful Oasis collective, a collaboration of like-minded developers focused on creating nature-themed games.

The makeup artist airbrushed my face and applied layers of natural palettes on my eyes, cheeks, and lips.\nEight hours and a number of takes later, the makeup artist retouched my face. To remove the dark smudges under my eyes, she wiped it off with a sponge and brush, and then reapplied concealer and powder.\nTwelve hours into our long, toxic day, the repetitive process of wiping my undereye area and reapplying powder and eyeliner was taking its toll. The skin around my eyes was beginning to feel itchy and tired from all the tugging. I resisted the urge to scratch and rub in fear of getting more irritation, and, not to mention, wrinkles!\nWhen we hit 20 hours on the set, my entire face was feeling sticky and itchy. Although we used oil blotters to make my face look shine-free on-cam, the feeling underneath the gunk wasn’t so heavenly. More wiping and retouching of my undereye area ensued. Yikes!\nWhen the director finally yelled, “That’s a wrap!” past 6 a.m. the next day, I gave a long sigh of relief. In my car I wiped everything off with makeup remover wipes, but because I lived a few hours away, I couldn’t thoroughly wash my face until I arrived home. After washing I applied eye cream and moisturizer before hitting the sack.\nWhen I woke up a few hours later, I looked at my face in the mirror and spotted bumpy rashes (a.k.a. butlig) around my eye area! I panicked and used a facial scrub to wash my face again, followed by a helping of eye cream.\nTwo days later, the itchy butligs did not budge, so I Googled to see what organic treatment I could use. I found that coconut oil helps improve skin condition naturally, so I applied that in lieu of eye cream. There was no improvement after a day, so I called my friend, a professional makeup artist. She advised that I let my skin rest with no harsh scrubs or any skincare products for a day or two to let it heal naturally. If it doesn’t improve in a week, then it’s time to see a dermatologist.\nI freaked out, but followed her advice. I also avoided wearing makeup. The bumps shrunk within a week, but it took about three whole weeks before my skin went back to normal.\n1. Don’t overdo it. Rigorous scrubbing and using too many skincare products can actually make facial rashes worse.\n2. Heal, don’t conceal. Our common instinct is to hide any signs of imperfection, like zits or rashes the moment we spot them. Sure, layering it with concealer will temporarily hide it, but it’s best to give your skin time to heal, even if it means airing out your rashes or zits for the world to see.\n3. Sunglasses or eyeglasses make a great camouflage. Take it from celebs who wear giant sunglasses after a prickly facial or to cover a makeup-less face.", "url": "https://www.cosmo.ph/beauty/skin/i-wore-makeup-for-24-hours-and-here-s-what-happened"}

{"text": "<p>Is there a way to tell if an event handler has been added to an object?  I'm serializing a list of objects into/out of session state so we can use SQL based session state... When an object in the list has a property changed it needs to be flagged, which the event handler took care of properly before.  However now when the objects are deserialized it isn't getting the event handler.</p>\n\n<p>In an fit of mild annoyance, I just added the event handler to the Get property that accesses the object.  It's getting called now which is great, except that it's getting called like 5 times so I think the handler just keeps getting added every time the object is accessed.</p>\n\n<p>It's really safe enough to just ignore, but I'd rather make it that much cleaner by checking to see if the handler has already been added so I only do so once.</p>\n\n<p>Is that possible?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I don't necessarily have full control of what event handlers are added, so just checking for null isn't good enough.  </p>\n\n<p>From outside the defining class, as @Telos mentions, you can only use EventHandler on the left-hand side of a <code>+=</code> or a <code>-=</code>. So, if you have the ability to modify the defining class, you could provide a method to perform the check by checking if the event handler is <code>null</code> - if so, then no event handler has been added. If not, then maybe and you can loop through the values in \n<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.delegate.getinvocationlist.aspx\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Delegate.GetInvocationList</a>. If one is equal to the delegate that you want to add as event handler, then you know it's there.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public bool IsEventHandlerRegistered(Delegate prospectiveHandler)\n{   \n    if ( this.EventHandler != null )\n    {\n        foreach ( Delegate existingHandler in this.EventHandler.GetInvocationList() )\n        {\n            if ( existingHandler == prospectiveHandler )\n            {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And this could easily be modified to become \"add the handler if it's not there\". If you don't have access to the innards of the class that's exposing the event, you may need to explore <code>-=</code> and <code>+=</code>, as suggested by @Lou Franco. </p>\n\n<p>However, you may be better off reexamining the way you're commissioning and decommissioning these objects, to see if you can't find a way to track this information yourself.</p>\n", "url": null}

{"text": "I never liked all the flak Nintendo got for debuting Zero Suit Samus. I think it's a very cool costume design! So to prove that it's not sexist, I put it on a character even shapelier than Samus Aran - Namco's Pac-Man!\nSo, Pac-Man with no botty and boobies.\nThan,he will use the robot that he used in Tekken as his power suit?\nYou can't beat curves like that. But wouldn't Ms. Pac-Man have been more appropriate?\nBut seriously, I'll have to agree with your comments that the Zero Suit isn't sexist, at least it's better than what most females wear. Skin-tight as it is, Samus is completely covered, unlike Wonder Woman, Lara Croft, Cortana, Tifa Lockheart, Supergirl, Hawkgirl/woman, and so on into infinity. If I was Samus, I'd want something between my skin and all that Power Suit... Otherwise one would quickly become very, very sore ALL OVER.\n:two cents: I do think Nintendo is objectifying Samus by steadily decreasing her Amazonian proportions, however. And I'm not talking about her curves; she's steadily lost the towering height and large muscles from the end of Super Metroid. By Other M she's almost as small and skinny as, well, every other Japanese character.\nTo be fair, Other M was crappy on a bunch of different levels.\nBut I must admit: It never crossed my mind to have Ms. Pac-Man be the subject of this picture. What a world.\n\"...to be fair, Other M was crappy on a bunch of different levels.\"\nI... sold it before I completed it.\nI can't blame you. Unbelievable as it my sound, the ending was the crusty icing on a very rancid cake.

{"text": "This week we continue \"chatting\" about Felicity Kendal, who is familiar to MPT viewers through her starring roles in Rosemary & Thyme and Good Neighbors. As good as she is in those shows, Kendal's real talent is in the delivery of Shakespeare's language - hardly surprising considering she grew up touring around India with her parents' Shakespeare troupe, Shakespeareana.\nRudman and their son, Jacob.\nWhen Kendal turned 17, she rebelled. Going against her parents' wishes she bowed out of the troupe, in which she'd been a member since a baby, and she returned to England. Her father was furious.\n\"You stupid little b****r. You'll marry the first clot you meet and end up in hell with mortgages and misery,\" recalls Kendall. \"He just couldn't understand why I would want to opt out of this bohemian lifestyle he had created for his family and go back to England where I would have to fight for every role.\"\nFor the first year Kendal was back in Britain, it seemed her father was right. She struggled to get work and was almost on the point of admitting defeat and returning to England. Instead she decided to accept whatever job she was offered - it turned out to be a terrible West End play that closed after just seven days. Kendal eventually managed to get work in a two person television play called The Mayfly and the Frog, appearing opposite John Gielgud. Another flop followed; the role of a lesbian in a West End play in which the bikini clad Kendal had to mud wrestle! At least her reviews were good!\nKendal's first husband, Drewe Henley.\nIn the meantime, while striving to make it as an actress, Kendal married. She was just 21 years old. Her husband, Drewe Henley, was older, had been married before and was in Kendal's eyes much more sophisticated. Just months after they married though, Henley, began suffering from bouts of manic depression.\n\"We went from bliss and glamour to total horror,\" says Kendal.\nHenley's illness, which came on immediately after he concluded filming Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope in 1977 in which he played Garven Dreis, was terrifying. He was violent against himself and deeply troubled.\n\"Tom and Barbara\" in The Good Life.\n\"One of the most difficult things is accepting the person you love has a problem, and you can't do anything to help,\" says Kendal. \"You try and reason, if we had another baby, if we moved house, if we went on holiday, it will make a difference. So you join in this half lie. You do your bit and it doesn't make any difference. It was very dark, and some of that darkness attaches itself to you.\"\nThe marriage lasted 11 years, during which time the couple had a son, Charlie, and Kendal became a public figure when she was cast in The Good Life (Good Neighbors).\n\"It was really hard doing The Good Life while my first marriage was disintegrating. The show was the very opposite of what was going on in my home life,\" remembers Kendal.\nKendal's second marriage was to American theatre director Michael Rudman, with whom she had a son, Jacob. The marriage broke up in 1991 when Kendal had an affair with playwright Tom Stoppard, who left his wife for her. The relationship lasted seven years. Then in 1998, Kendal went back to Rudman and although they never remarried the couple is still together.\nNot long after Kendal and Rudman married, her beloved sister, Jenifer died, at age 51, leaving a 16-year-old, an 18-year-old and a 20-year-old. Jennifer had remained in India after marrying the Indian actor, Shashi Kapoor. Her death had a profound effect on Kendal. Despite their 13 year age gap, the two were extremely close. Not a day of their lives went by that they weren't in communication, if not in person then either by letter or phone.\nwho was only 51 when she died of cancer.\n\"It changed me,\" says Kendal of her sister's death. \"She was all my friends, my sister and mother in a way because she was older than me and looked after me a lot of the time.\"\nNow it's Kendal who is doing the looking after. Along with her own children, and grandchildren, Kendal is a surrogate mom and grandmom to her sister's children and grandchildren. It's a role she revels in and Kendal does as much as she can for the children, including at least two school runs a week.\n\"I love being available to help,\" says the family matriarch, \"but when I am working I can disappear for months.\" Hopefully Kendal won't disappear from our scenes for too long!", "url": "http://afternoontea.mpt.org/blogs/mpt-afternoon-tea/felicity-kendal-part-two/"}

Through UPP, we shall demand equity in the Nigeria project because we are equal stakeholders in the project.”\nThe guber aspirant said he has no political godfather but was depending on Anambra people for his aspiration, while charging them to make their token donation to his governorship project.\nWhile commenting on the perceived zoning arrangement in the state, Chidoka said zoning has always deprived the people of the first brains in an election pointing out that Anambra people should count themselves lucky for having an array from all the geopolitical zones who are fit for governorship.\nOn his relationship with the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, the former minister said he was never a part of the group but added that he believes that Igbo should get equal treatment like every other persons from the northern and western parts of Nigeria.\nThis post was syndicated from THISDAYLIVE.

The \"|=\" operator is an or then assign operator, which is simply shorthand for rule = rule | 0x80.</p>\n\n<p>One of the niftier things about C# is that it lets you do crazy things like abuse value types simply based on their size.  An 'int' is exactly the same as a byte, except the compiler will throw warnings if you try and use them as both at the same time.  Simply sticking with one (in this case, int) works well.  If you're concerned about 64bit readiness, you can specify int32, but all ints are int32s, even running in x64 mode.</p>\n", "url": null}

{"text": "Welcome to my travel blog. My name is James Frazermann and I’ve been fortunate enough to travel many places throughout the world. Many people would argue that world travel changes a person in very positive ways, making their vision wider and enrich their creativity.\nThe next best thing, or for people planning future trips is to read about other traveler’s eye opening experiences. I thought it would be great to document my experiences in South East Asia and beyond, in hope to deliver some value to others who wanted to go these locations or simply learn more about these countries and their wonderful culture and people. I look forward to seeing the new blog grow and hearing what readers think about it. It’s really a pleasure to write about.\nPhilippines and Thailand were two of the highlights of my travels. Both countries had their own unique benefits and things to enjoy. In Bangkok I ventured to the Pakkred Babies Home Orphanage, a place desperately in need of funding and assistance of all kinds. A life changing experience, it truly illustrates the differences between the East and West when it comes to the most disadvantaged people and the situations they are forced to live in and make it through. Bathing elephants and tasting the abundance of cuisine Thailand has to offer was also high on the lists.\nSwimming with whale sharks, Kawasan Falls jungle trek, and staying on NoaNoa Island were also standout adventures for me in the Philippines. And of course, who could forget the filipino smile everywhere you go!\nSo take a look round, and hopefully you can pick up some travel tips and get a brief glimpse into what South East Asia has to offer.", "url": "https://www.jamesfrazermann.co.uk/"}

Auf diese Weise habe ich meine Auswahl aus ein paar sehr guten Handschuhen getroffen – jeweils einen für das Skifahren oder den Skilanglauf. Ich werde sagen, dass ich, wie bei vielen Rezensionen über neue Ski- und Snowboardausrüstung vieler ihrer Marken in diesen Tagen, nicht der größte Schneeschuhläufer oder Skirennläufer bin – dennoch sind diese Handschuhe ausgezeichnet! Ich werde jedoch meine Meinung sagen: Wenn der Schnee ein Problem ist, dann holen Sie sich den Snowflex, der wird Ihnen gut tun, und Sie sind auf den Pisten wahrscheinlich besser geeignet als da draußen ohne Traktion! Wenn wir gerade erst mit dem Skifahren anfangen, dann ist mein persönlicher Vorschlag, einen Bericht über Skihandschuhe für Männer zu lesen, den ich im Link unten habe!\nWorauf kommt es außerdem an für Herren Skihandschuhe Testsieger?\nWichtig bei einer Überprüfung der Skihandschuhe für Männer ist auch, wie sie sich festhalten. Ich habe zwar schon bessere Handschuhe bei den Frauen gesehen, aber die meisten Leute waren wahrscheinlich noch nie mit diesen Handschuhen unterwegs. daher scheint es die beste Art zu sein, die Herrenhandschuhe zu überprüfen (zumindest nehme ich dies für diejenigen an, die die Handschuhe noch nie getragen haben, denn das scheint der wahrscheinlichste Fall zu sein. Und die einzigen mir bekannten Besitzer von Herrenhandschuhen, die es schon einmal versucht haben, könnten viel davon profitieren.\nIm Herren Skihandschuhe Test ist vor allem Verarbeitung, Qualität und der Preis entscheidend.\nNach dem Tag auf der Heizung und sind stellenweise aufgegangen. Auch bei kaltem Wetter gab s bei uns beim Skifahren bei Wind und minus 10 Grad und meine Hände gut und die Hände waschen da sie nicht zu sehr auf den Handschuhen recht stark das Schwitzen an, die Größe S genommen und die Hände angenehm warm. Allerdingst löst sich das innenfutter beim ausziehen was auf der Piste war etwas Nässe in den Handschuhen blieb . Kein Wasser/Feuchtigkeit kommen die Nähte und der Schnee dringt beim Schmelzen nicht ein, weil er wasserdicht ist und dabei auch die Wärme möglichst haltet. Die Handschuhe fühlen sich gut an und sehen in grau/ schwarz auch noch ein paar Nähte den Geist aufgegeben und sind sehr warm, sind sehr gut, an Handgelenken und Manschetten gibt es auch wasserdicht. Weiche Fütterung für hohen Tragekomfort und breiter Klettriegel für optimale Fixierung am Handgelenk . Kaufabentwicklung und Versand ist wie angegeben und man kommt selbst mit feuchten Händen wieder gut in die Handschuhe noch tragen zu können. Ich habe normalgroße Hände und die Hände bleiben angenehm warm. Wobei ich auch in normalen beispielsweise Nitril Handschuhen habe, denke ich, bei -4 °, kalte Fingerspitzen gehabt. Ich kauf mir definitiv keine Kaufempfehlung.\nFazit im Herren Skihandschuhe Test\nWichtig bei einer Überprüfung der Skihandschuhe für Männer ist auch, wie diese mit einem Handschuh greifen, denn ich tue es nicht. Ich habe mich noch nie wohl dabei gefühlt, Skijobs in Skischuhe zu stecken, weil sich der Handschuh als Griffpunkt nicht ganz richtig anfühlt und ich mich jedes Mal anpassen muss. Diese fühlen sich toll an! Die Handschuhe selbst sind sehr dünn, ich meine, wirklich dünn im Vergleich zu dem, was andere Skifirmen mit ihren Handschuhen machen müssen, haben diese eine gute Größenspanne von 3 – 6 Fingern breit (ohne Daumen!).\nFür Herren Skihandschuhe Testsieger also sehr wichtig: Am Abend habe ich mir dringend diese Handschuhe zum Skifahren und Fahrradfahren. Diese Handschuhe halten die Finger sehr warm und in gute Qualität.\nSchwimmhandschuh Vergleich", "url": "https://clean-winners.de/herren-skihandschuhe-vergleich/"}

{"text": "Alfred and Rose, portrayed by Sidney and Xavier, in the hearth kitchen at Historic Locust Grove in Louisville, Kentucky. – Photo by Heather R. Hiner/Fox and Rose Photography.\nIn my previous post, I shared the story of an enslaved man named Alfred who was most likely sold by the Croghan family of Historic Locust Grove as punishment for an unknown act. This post begins a series on the life of a second man, Alfred Croghan.\nFor the most part, the enslaved people who lived and labored at Locust Grove in Louisville, Kentucky are poorly documented. When I started this research project, Alfred Croghan was documented better then most. But “better than most” is a low bar. I knew his first name, the approximate year of his birth, and that he had spent part of his adult life at Mammoth Cave. After many, many hours of research and with the help of librarians, archivists, and others, I am excited to share that Alfred Croghan has gone from being poorly documented to being the first enslaved person owned by the Croghan family that we can trace from a child at Locust Grove to his death as a free man in Louisville.\nAlfred’s first documented appearance may be in the 1820 Census. According to the census, half of the enslaved people living at Locust Grove were 14 or younger. I cannot be entirely sure that Alfred is one of the children listed in the census because the only person listed by name is the head of the household, Major William Croghan. Major Croghan’s family and the enslaved people he owned are not listed by name.\n1820 Federal Census for William Croghan (highlighted in yellow). Alfred Croghan may have been one of the eight male enslaved children seen in the census (highlighted in orange).\nI have not come across any records of births of enslaved children at Locust Grove. However, I am pretty confident that Alfred was born in 1820 based on some wonderful photographs I will share in a future post about Alfred. The census was taken in August of 1820, which means if Alfred was born before August, he is one of the eight enslaved male children living at Locust Grove who were recorded on the census.\nPortrait of William Croghan, Jr.\nThe only real glimpse of Alfred’s childhood that we have is a letter written by William Croghan, Jr. to his three year old son, William Croghan III in 1828. In fact, it is the best account of enslaved children in general that we have and is a treasure trove of information.\nBased on a birth year of 1820 and with no other records pointing to another man around the same age with the same name owned by the Croghans, it is a near certainty that “Al” is an eight year old Alfred Croghan. It’s an account that shows an exuberant boy who is bold enough to be a bit cheeky with William, Jr.\nWilliam Croghan, Jr. inherited Locust Grove from his father in 1822 and continued to live there until the death of his wife in October of 1827. Devastated by his loss, William and his children moved to Pittsburgh where he could manage his late wife’s estate. He wrote the above letter to his son in Pittsburgh one after the death of his wife while he was visiting Locust Grove.\nBeing moved to Pittsburgh to serve William’s daughter, Mary, followed by being passed between other members of the Croghan family would have been an experience Alfred shared with other enslaved people owned by the Croghans. It was a common practice for the Croghans to loan, buy, or sell, enslaved people who belonged to their family amongst themselves.\nUnder the ownership of Dr. John Croghan, William, Jr.’s, oldest brother, Alfred would become one of the enslaved guides of Mammoth Cave. Working alongside the storied Stephen Bishop, Materson Bransford, and Nicholas Bransford, Alfred would leave his own marks at the cave and become a part of it’s history. And that’s a story for the next blog post, so stay tuned!\nWhen trying to decide on what to share first, I kept going back to something I posted on my personal Facebook page a few months ago. In the spirit of not filling my friend’s feeds with a great wall of text, I tried to pare my thoughts down as much as possible and it was still a lot for a medium that isn’t necessarily set up for sharing thoughts that are more appropriate for a blog. As more and more of my research projects have led to a desire to share what I have found along with my thoughts on the process of unearthing facts from the past and how they translate to life today, I have finally decided to give them a more proper home here. And since this was the post that got the ball rolling, I feel it is only appropriate to expand upon and share that original Facebook post here.\nWhile I plan to post on a wide array of subjects, this particular project, researching the enslaved people that belonged to Croghan family of Historic Locust Grove, may be the most important research I have ever done and as such will appear quite a bit here. I am very proud to be a volunteer at a site where bringing these stories to the forefront is a priority.\nToday, I begin to organize and expand on the research on the enslaved people of Locust Grove that I have have been doing off and on for the past two years. I find myself in a different mindset than I usually am when I tackle research. Normally, I’m energized and very focused when I settle into a research project. There’s a sense of satisfaction when I turn up something new and expand on someone’s story. I get very excited when I discover something that allows us to relate to and empathize with someone from the past. I still feel those things, but this time, there are other feelings, too.\nStone from the remains of a slave cabin at Historic Locust Grove.\nI feel a greater need to turn over every stone and pebble, to find the tiniest of facts. There are so few that no matter how small, they are all significant. I find my heart heavier at times as I try to grapple with understanding lives lived that I can never fully comprehend because their experiences were so different from mine. There’s a desire to fill in the gaps and give agency and voice to these people who had so little of it in their lifetimes and who were often silenced or ignored by history. There’s anger at how the details of their lives were recorded by others and frustration on the scarcity of information available. And there’s hope, hope that I can somehow do justice to their memories, to their struggles and triumphs, and to the lives they lived.\nThere’s also a weight to the process. It weighs on me. How do I properly share someone else’s story? Can I do justice to them? There’s concern if my self taught research skills are enough to fully convey someone’s existence that was so very different from my own. In the end, I always circle back to the idea that something done in the spirit of love and service to another is worthwhile in spite of the fact that I am still learning the best ways to research and share. It also drives me to keep learning how to convey these stories in a better way.\nRemains of a tree growing on the foundation of a slave cabin at Historic Locust Grove.\nAnd there’s also a beautiful solemnity to the process. This past spring, I photographed the ruins of the foundation of the slave cabin in the woods at Historic Locust Grove so they have a visual record of it’s current condition. As I was trying to figure out which pictures I needed to take, I also found myself reflecting on who might have lived there. Who from my list of names made this their home? Was this Charlotte’s house, or maybe this is where Criss lived? Or could this be the abode of Hannah, Isaac, Alfred, or someone whose name was never recorded? Who cooked meals here, raised their children, rested after a long day’s labor? We don’t know and it’s possible we never will.\nBut we do know this: There’s no slave cemetery at Locust Grove. We have some theories and guesses about the final resting places of these people, but ultimately, we just don’t know for sure. That, of course, is it’s own kind of indignity when you look at the family graveyard so carefully preserved. Was the “child of Beaty”, who died from bilious fever in the fall of 1832, buried in an unmarked grave outside the boundary of the family cemetery as was often the case, or was this unnamed child laid to rest somewhere else on the property? It’s a mystery that may never be solved.\nBut I do know this: enslaved people lived their lives and worked to carve out their own space on the site of that cabin foundation. They existed in that space and the simple act of naming their names, of standing where they stood and remembering them is a spiritual act of remembrance.\nRemains of the foundation of a slave cabin at Historic Locust Grove.\nAs I moved around the space, trying to find the angles to properly record the building’s remains, I couldn’t help but feel the presence of those who lived there over 200 years ago. Standing by myself, among the scattered stones in the quiet woods, I was struck that it was a very sacred space. And so I left my own stone, my own token of remembrance, just like I do when I visit a grave. There may not be a slave cemetery, but this space was more their’s than most on the property and it just felt right to honor their passing there, where they had lived.\nHow I felt as I recorded the site has become an overriding reminder of why I do this and it does add to the weight of it all. How do I do right by these people who were marginalized during their lifetimes and forgotten after their deaths? Ultimately, I know I can never fully give them the justice they deserve and that the best I can do is to gather what we have and hopefully find a few new details to fill in the narratives of their lives. And so I organize, and search, and dig, and hope I do well by them. I share their names and their stories and honor their memories in doing so.", "url": "http://pastinfocus.com/tag/slavery/"}

{"text": "Sobre la retransmisión de los juicios penales. Por Diego Fierro Rodríguez El Correo de España\nDiego Fierro - 15 junio 2019\nLa retransmisión en abierto de los juicios penales está comenzando a comentarse como una opción viable y deseable. El juicio por la Causa especial 20907/2017, iniciada por los actos de obstrucción al cumplimiento de la Constitución, se ha difundido por Internet conforme a lo establecido por el Auto del Tribunal Supremo de 1 de febrero de 2019. Esa resolución indica que la Sala II “ha acordado -superando así restricciones históricas todavía vigentes en la mayoría de los países de nuestro entorno- que las sesiones del juicio sean televisadas en directo y mediante streaming en la web”, destacando que “La consecuencia inmediata es que todo ciudadano que quiera convertirse en observador, nacional o internacional, del desarrollo del juicio podrá hacerlo” y que “No existirá, por tanto, límite numérico alguno para el seguimiento permanente y sin interrupción de las sesiones del juicio mediante señal de televisión en directo o en streaming” para lograr “una fiscalización incondicionada de todas y cada una de las sesiones del plenario”.\nAhora se ha planteado la posibilidad de retransmitir el juicio de los discos duros de Luis Bárcenas. El PP y el Ministerio Fiscal se han opuesto a la retransmisión de este último proceso alegando que la difusión afectaría negativamente al honor de los acusados, entre los que se encuentra el partido político de Pablo Casado, habiendo obtenido con éxito la estimación de su solicitud.\nLa actitud de los representantes del PP demuestra que los dirigentes políticos temen más el proceso penal por la imagen que puede dar de ellos que por las consecuencias sancionadoras que se pueden derivar de la sentencia que se dicte para la terminación de los trámites. Este hecho no resulta extraño teniendo presente que parece sentirse más respeto o más temor por la opinión pública que por los jueces y tribunales.\nCiertamente, habría que comenzar a pensar en retransmitir todos los juicios penales en los que estuvieran implicados dirigentes públicos o partidos políticos, con independencia de las siglas. De ese modo, se garantizaría la transparencia en esos procesos, que tienen una gran relevancia social, y se aseguraría un adecuado acceso a la información que podría evitar que se impulsen procesos paralelos, pues cualquiera tendría la opción de ver objetivamente cuál es el desarrollo de los trámites por los que el órgano jurisdiccional competente debe dictar sentencia conforme a las leyes y se restringiría mucho la posibilidad de manipular datos sobre las actuaciones procesales que, en muchos casos, se presentan de manera alterada con la intención de perjudicar la imagen pública de uno o varios sujetos.", "url": "https://elcorreodeespana.com/article.php?idarticulo=198484661&url=Sobre-la-retransmision-de-los-juicios-penales-Por-Diego-Fierro-Rodriguez-&sub=opinion"}

{"text": "Game of Thrones star: Season 8 to film until next summer\n\nEven though season 8 will have Game of Thrones‘ fewest episodes ever, the production might spend as much time filming as before — increasing the evidence that GoT will return in 2019, skipping next year entirely.\nLiam Cunningham, who plays Ser Davos Seaworth, told TV Guide on Thursday: “[The episodes are] definitely going to be bigger and what I hear is longer,” he said. “We’re filming right up until the summer. When you think about it, up until last season we’d have six months to do ten episodes, so we’re [doing] way more than that for six episodes. So that obviously will translate into longer episodes.”\nGoT normally films for about six months, typically wrapping around December (the recent seventh season, which aired in the summer for the first time, shot from August to February). The final season starts shooting this month. If the production continues filming “right up until summer” that’s six months, at least, as Cunningham points out (and some rumors peg the season’s length of production as even longer).\nAs for the production length, GoT showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss first told EW they plan to spend a year and a half making the final season. EW also first reported that GoT might not return to 2019. With production not wrapping until summer, a 2019 rollout seems like an increasingly sure bet given the extensive amount of post-production required for the fantasy hit. Plus HBO’s other big splashy genre title Westworld is returning after nearly two years sometime in 2018 — there’s no premiere date yet — so it’s a good bet HBO will put its spotlight on the badass bots next year while focusing its Game of Thrones efforts on promoting season 7 for that fall’s Emmy consideration.\nAs for Cunningham’s other revelation, that the episodes will be longer, we’re less positive on that one at this point. The actor’s phrasing suggests he hadn’t yet received the scripts and another beloved Ser — Iain Glen (Ser Jorah Mormont) recently gave a very different reason for a longer production time: The final season will typically only have one unit filming at a time — much like a regular TV show. GoT in the past has often had two units — occasionally three, and very briefly even four — shooting simultaneously, typically in at least two countries. “I think this last season will take much longer to shoot because they can only use one unit because we’re all in the same sort of scenes,” Glen said. “We’re all starting to occupy the same territory, we’re all starting to be in the same storylines and so they can’t [have two filming units] anymore.”\nSo that’s two different reasons why GoT will spend so long on six episodes. Both Sers could be right (and we hope they are). We would be shocked if there weren’t at least a couple really long episodes in the final season as the last two seasons had episodes that broke the GoT record for longest-episodes ever. The cast will all know for certain how big those scripts are very soon — there’s a final season table read this Sunday.\nSeason 8 will be directed by three teams of directors: Previous GoT Emmy winners Miguel Sapochnik and David Nutter, along with the showrunners Benioff and Weiss.

{"text": "Be fire safe this holiday season\n\nThe only chance people have of surviving a fire in their home is early detection.\nHaving an escape plan also increases the odds, said Welland Fire and Emergency Services chief Brian Kennedy.\n“It’s the season to be careful. Every year it seems there’s a fire with catastrophic results for families. We want to avoid that throughout the year, particularly during the Christmas season,” the chief said.\nHe said the top two causes of fires during the holiday season are smoking and cooking.\nSmoking accounts for 30 per cent of all home fire deaths during the holidays, and for 1 in 10 fire injuries. Cooking fires account for 19 per cent of all homes fires, and 27 per cent of injuries, according to information from the Office of the Fire Marshal.\nKennedy said a fire on McAlpine Avenue in mid-November that sent one man to hospital with serious injuries was caused by unattended cooking.\n“If the resident had gone to bed and fallen asleep, we’d have a totally different end result to that fire.”\nFirefighters found there was a non-functional smoke alarm in the home, and at the time Kennedy said charges were pending against the homeowner.\nHe said if people are cooking, they should stay in the kitchen while doing so and make sure they have properly-fitted lids for whatever they are using. He said in the event of a grease fire, the best thing to do is cover up the pot or pan you are using. Trying to carry a pot or pan could lead to spreading the fire, getting burned or inhaling potentially toxic smoke.\nAs for the McAlpine Avenue resident not having a functional smoke alarm in his home, Kennedy said at least 50 per cent of the homes the fire service has been in across Welland don’t have working smoke alarms or carbon monoxide detectors.\n“How many people have to die before people start to put smoke alarms in?” he said.\nKennedy said Port Colborne Fire and Emergency Services chief Tom Cartwright launched an aggressive smoke alarm campaign following a fatal house fire in December of last year.\n“They got into a lot of homes and it did a lot of good. Hopefully, it will see some changes in that community. We want to get that same message out to our people.”\nThe chief said at a minimum, people should check their smoke and carbon monoxide detectors and change the batteries at least once a year.\n“Make sure you have the things you need in your home to protect your family. It doesn’t cost a lot of money to protect you and your family. It’s amazing how many people fluff it off and think, ‘It’ll never happen to me,’ and then it does happen to them,” said Kennedy.\nWelland firefighters do inspect homes every year and have targeted neighbourhoods in the past.\n“After a fire, we’ll target that area and it’s worked out very well. It’s increased our ability to get into homes and talk to residents. We talk about fire escape planning and the requirements for smoke and carbon monoxide detectors.”\nSmoke alarms are mandatory on every storey of a home and outside all sleeping areas, and any residence with a fuel-fired appliance requires a carbon monoxide alarm outside all sleeping areas or if there is an attached garage. Carbon monoxide alarm are mandatory in all new builds in the province, as well.\nKennedy said the fire service had a call this past Friday where residents heard a strange beeping in their home and called 911. Once on scene, firefighters found there were no working smoke or carbon monoxide detectors.\n“It’s a culture change we’re looking for here. When seatbelts came in it took a long time for people to transition to wearing them. Smoke alarms are no different.”\nResidents can have the fire service come check on their smoke and carbon monoxide detectors if they think there is a problem by calling 911 or the business line and asking for the platoon chief.\n“If people have nothing, we’ll install them,” he said, adding the fire service can lay charges for lack of compliance if needed.\nKennedy said it’s frustrating for the firefighters and fire service to see that lack of compliance so high in Welland.\nAnd with fires burning hotter and quicker these days due to building construction and furniture inside homes, it’s more important to have working detectors and a fire escape plan, the chief said.\nWith the holiday season upon us, he said it’s also important people make sure they keep natural Christmas trees well-watered and away from any potential ignition sources and not to overload electrical circuits with too many lights. Space heaters, he said, should also be kept away potential ignition sources.\nWith smoking being a leading cause of fires at this time of year as well, Kennedy said people should have guests smoke outside of homes and if anyone is smoking inside, check the furniture because cigarette butts can smolder for hours.", "url": "http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/2017/12/11/be-fire-safe-this-holiday-season"}

{"text": "Soldier in Bloody Niger Mission Had Warned of Gaps, Defense Officials Say\n\nThe two Defense Department officials, both of whom have knowledge of the preliminary findings, spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation has not yet been released. One official cautioned that the findings could change as Mr. Mattis and General Dunford review them.\n“This is not consistent with the approval for this type of re-mission,” said Brig. Gen. Donald C. Bolduc, who retired shortly after handing over command of Special Operations forces in Africa in June.\n“Captains do not have this authority,” said General Bolduc, referring to the rank of the junior officers. “Plus, if the ground commander pushes back on the mission, this should be a red flag for everyone in the chain of command.”\nPhoto\nA third Defense Department official said the leader of Team 3212, Capt. Michael Perozeni, had filed a “concept of operations” document — or Conop — that showed he planned only a daylong trip to meet with tribal elders when he and his soldiers left their base in Ouallam, Niger, on Oct. 3.\nInstead, the team was rerouted miles away, toward the Mali border. Its repeatedly changing overnight mission targeted Mr. Cheffou, a former cattle herder believed to be involved in the kidnapping of an American in Mali.\nThe preliminary findings, according to the first two Defense Department officials, imply that senior officers up the chain of command believed Team 3212 was embarking only on the daylong reconnaissance mission, as Captain Perozeni outlined in his Conop document. That trip, of 11 Americans and some 30 Nigerien soldiers, described a “civil reconnaissance” mission meant for “key-leader engagement meetings.”\nBefore he left Ouallam, those officials said, Captain Perozeni received the order to join the kill-or-capture mission against Mr. Cheffou, to be led by a separate assault force flying out of the town of Arlit. The order came from another junior officer, who was filling in for a regional commander on paternity leave.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nCaptain Perozeni pushed back against the change of mission, citing concerns over insufficient intelligence and equipment available to his team on the high-risk raid. But he did not resist orders to back up the separate assault force, the officials said.\nAs it turned out, that mission was later scrapped because of bad weather. Team 3212 was still on its reconnaissance mission, near the town of Tiloa, when American intelligence officials concluded that Mr. Cheffou and a handful of fighters had left their desert encampment near the border with Mali. The team was ordered to press on to that location, hoping to collect any information left behind that might offer clues about Mr. Cheffou’s hide-outs and network.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\nBut the preliminary investigation indicates that senior officers at the Africa Command headquarters and its Special Operations component in Stuttgart were not informed of the change of plans. Nor were senior leaders at a Special Operations regional command in Chad, according to the findings.\nHowever, according to the third Defense Department official, a lieutenant colonel in Chad had already approved both the helicopter raid based from Arlit, which was scrapped, and Team 3212’s original reconnaissance mission, which had taken it just 15 miles from the ambush site outside the village of Tongo Tongo.\nAdditionally, that official said, Col. Bradley Moses, the head of 3rd Special Forces Group in Germany, was informed of the two missions. The official was not authorized to discuss the missions or the investigation publicly.\nPhoto\nCurrent and former military officials said they found it highly surprising that the captain who was filling in for the regional commander in Niger — Maj. Alan Van Saun — would have been empowered to redirect Team 3212 without higher approval. They also said it would be extraordinary that senior officers and their staffs, in Chad or in Germany, would not have been aware of or involved in that decision.\nHad it changed missions, the team would have been required to send in new routes — in part to be protected with medical evacuation support or other assistance if needed. Through a communications channel that was tethered to commanders at a base in Niamey, Niger’s capital, the team’s position would have been sent by either a satellite radio or phone and typed into a chat room monitored by the chain of command stretching from Niger to Germany. The team’s GPS tracker would also be monitored in Germany.\nIn short, the mission change should have been duly reported — and noted — by military officials from West Africa to Stuttgart.\nTeam 3212 came under fire on Oct. 4, as the soldiers headed back to Ouallam from Mr. Cheffou’s encampment. After stopping in Tongo Tongo for water, the American and Nigerien forces were ambushed and overpowered by militants who officials believe were linked to the Islamic State.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nCaptain Perozeni and Sgt. First Class Brent Bartels, the radio operator for Team 3212, were shot and wounded early in the Oct. 4 ambush. Four Americans — Staff Sgt. Bryan C. Black, Staff Sgt. Dustin M. Wright, Staff Sgt. Jeremiah W. Johnson and Sgt. La David Johnson — were killed.\nInitially, Pentagon officials said the results of the lengthy inquiry would be released in January to Congress, the American public and the families of the slain soldiers.\nSpeaking last week with reporters traveling with him to the Middle East and Afghanistan, Mr. Mattis said he expected aides to provide him with answers to several of his questions by no later than Monday. The secretary said he was also expecting General Dunford’s advice on the report soon.\nIn December, two months after the ambush, a separate team of Green Berets operating in a different part of Niger killed 11 Islamic State militants in a firefight. That battle was reported last week, by The New York Times, as one of at least 10 other previously undisclosed attacks on American troops in West Africa between 2015 and 2017.\nTogether, they indicate that the deadly October ambush was not an isolated episode in a nation where the United States is building a major drone base. No American or Nigerien forces were harmed in the December gun battle.\nThe American military did not disclose the December firefight or the others until pressed by The Times. “We don’t want to give a report card to our adversaries,” said Dana W. White, the Pentagon press secretary.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/world/africa/niger-ambush-defense-department-report.html?partner=rss&emc=rss"}

What he didn't detail were solutions to the crises ahead.\nTrump's 80-minute speech surveyed familiar territory for a president drawn to drama. He warned of gangs, nuclear threats, the drug epidemic and unlawful immigrants. He highlighted guests in the crowd, a group representing a mix of valor and victimhood, which he used to illustrate his calls for patriotism and perseverance.\n\"No people on Earth are so fearless, or daring, or determined as Americans,\" Trump said. \"If there is a mountain, we climb it. If there is a frontier, we cross it. If there is a challenge, we tame it. If there is an opportunity, we seize it.\"\nBut his vision for a way out of what he once described as \"American carnage\" was not nearly as clear. Although he said lowering prescription drug prices would be \"one of my greatest priorities,\" he did not suggest a strategy for getting it done. He hinted at hopes for reforming prisons, supporting family leave and improving job training, with little meat on the bone. He raised hopes for an infrastructure plan but provided little guidance as to how the plan should be funded.\nTrump's most detailed proposal was, perhaps, the most contentious.\nWhen Trump outlined his four-part immigration plan Tuesday, a grim-faced House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi held up her hands to try to silence the booing Democrats. Republicans, too, have deep reservations about his hopes for cutting legal immigration. The debate has left the fate of hundreds of thousands \"Dreamer\" immigrants uncertain, as they wait for a Trump-imposed expiration date for the program that protects them from deportation. Trump did not acknowledge that hurdle Tuesday, or the government shutdown looming if Democrats hold to their demands that a Dreamer deal must be tied to a budget plan.\nHe did advocate for compromise — an unusual role for the often strident president.\nThe deal is a \"down-the-middle compromise,\" he said. \"One where nobody gets everything they want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs.\"\nDemocrats are likely to remain deeply skeptical about Trump's ability to play the role of bipartisan broker. He has often shifted positions without notice and, at times, seemed unfamiliar with details.\n\"We need more than talk. We need a president who will bring the country together rather than foster further division,\" said Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California. \"We need a president who understands and engages in important issues rather than spending hours on Twitter.\"\nFreshman Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., said he was happy to hear Trump bring up infrastructure, controlling prescription drug prices and boosting vocational education but said he was short on detail. \"It sounds like, 'I'm for world peace.' Fine, how do you get there?\" Krishnamoorthi said.\nHe also contrasted Trump's words with what he's done as president: \"If you don't govern in a way that's consistent with your rhetoric, people are left wondering if these are just empty words.\"\nRepublican Sen. David Perdue of Georgia, who has been working closely with the White House, said he believes Trump offered guidance on finding a solution to the impasse on immigration.\n\"He's given a lot to both sides to make that happen,\" Perdue said. \"We're working on legislative action, this needs to be fixed in Congress. He's laid down the roadmap.\"\nTrump did not address his outsized role in fostering the party rancor.\nEver the salesman, Trump spent much of his speech highlighting the accomplishments of the last 12 months while taking credit for the nation's roaring economy and booming stock market. Suppressing his penchant for making the moment about himself, Trump repeatedly highlighted the guests sitting in the Capitol, each of whom possessed a powerful story.\nThere was a North Korean defector who defiantly waved the crutches he used to make his escape after losing a leg. There were the New Mexico police officers who adopted the baby of a heroin addict. And the tearful black family who lost their child at the hands of an immigrant who had entered the United States illegally.\nHis Twitter largely silent for a day, Trump holstered his usual partisan weaponry in favor of \"an open hand to work with members of both parties, Democrats and Republicans, to protect our citizens, of every background, color and creed.\"\n___\nAssociated Press Writer Jonathan Lemire has covered the White House and politics for The Associated Press since 2013.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Tom LoBianco and Mary Clare Jalonick in Washington and Charles Arbogast in Chicago contributed to this report.\n___\nFollow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire", "url": "https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3354666"}

{"text": "Lamborghini Hops on the Supercar SUV Bandwagon\n\nLamborghini Hops on the Supercar SUV Bandwagon\nSupercar makers have long known that parked next to that snarling Lamborghini, racing-red Ferrari, or stately Bentley at some of the globe's toniest addresses is a practical SUV. With the sport utility vehicle market growing by leaps and bounds, they increasingly want in on those profits.\nLamborghini unveils the once-improbable Urus SUV on Monday at its headquarters in Sant'Agata, Italy, where the supercar maker owned by the Volkswagen group is expanding the factory to meet utility vehicle demand. The Urus enters a luxury field crowded with the Mercedes G-Class, the Bentley Bentayga and the trailblazing Porsche Cayenne -- and soon to be joined by Aston Martin, Rolls Royce and, in all probability, Ferrari.\nAnalysts say that the move into SUVs has become a natural fit for most brands, even supercar makers like Lamborghini, despite the risk of alienating aficionados.\n\"I think if you look at those brands' image, I think you would look at an SUV -- especially a Lamborghini -- as almost a sell-out move. I don't think that is the case anymore,\" Jeff Schuster, senior vice president at LMC Automotive in Detroit. \"There is some risk to the purist, who can only see one view of the brand. But as long as they don't move too far out of who they are, a lineup can include an SUV in these brands. I wouldn't have said that five years ago.\"\nFrom bring nonexistent in 2006, high-end SUVs have more than quadrupled in sales since 2010, from 4,700 units to almost 21,000 units in 2016, driven by the Mercedes G-Class and Bentley Bentayga, according to IHS Automotive. The entry of the Urus along with the planned Aston Martin DBX and Rolls Royce \"High Side Vehicle\" is expected to push those numbers up to 29,300 by 2020. Even Ferrari is considering entering the category, with a decision expected early next year, which could leave McLaren as the only hold-out among supercars.\nLuxury SUVS are merely following the mass-market trend. SUVs are the fastest-growing overall segment of the market, tripling in sales in a decade from just under 8 million units in 2006 to nearly 26.5 million units last year. SUV sales are forecast by IHS Automotive to grow by another 28 percent to over 34 million units by 2020.\nBefore having a true luxury option, IHS automotive analyst Ian Fletcher said, many SUV owners went to private modifiers and tuners to increase performance and add luxury swag to their off-the-line mass-market vehicle. \"A lot of manufacturers said, 'Oh, we can have a piece of that,'\" Fletcher said.\nPorsche proved the market with the Cayenne, and was followed by the Mercedes G-Class, \"which went from being utilitarian to being something synonymous with the Kardashians,\" he said.\nThe decision to enter the SUV market was a no-brainer for Lamborghini, which as part of the VW group shares luxury SUV platforms with the Bentley Bentayga and the Audi Q7, bringing down development costs and increasing profit margins.\n\"The Urus looks like it will be far more rakish than the SUV range that the VW group has, and far more dynamic,\" Fletcher said. Trailers of the Urus show the vehicle spinning around the desert, an obvious fob to Middle Eastern brand enthusiasts, but could also appeal to buyers in Africa and Russia, where road conditions in some areas may have discouraged buyers from indulging in the lower-slung sportscars.\n\"They are aiming to have a vehicle which epitomizes what the brand's core characteristics are: sport, high performance and accessible to customers who had to give up a sports car because they are having children, or just couldn't get into a sports car any more or it wasn't practical,\" Fletcher said. \"It broadens the brand to a wider group.\"\nIHS forecasts Urus sales of 2,900 a year to a peak in 2019-2020, putting it on par with the Lamborghini Huracan. And as with cars in the super luxury segment, the profit margins can be astronomical.\nIn the United States, SUVS are reshaping the luxury market, outpacing car sales and reaching a new audience, with the appeal strongest in trend-setting cities like Los Angeles, Miami and New York.\n\"I think car companies want to keep the brand pure, but they cannot ignore the market right now,\" said Jessica Caldwell, senior analyst at Edmunds. \"They are in the business to make money and I think that is why they are going this route.\"\n© 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

{"text": "Poynter’s News University expands e-learning platform\n\nBy Staff on June 29, 2016\nDigital learning has taken on a whole new meaning. Photo: Shutterstock.\nThe Poynter Institute for Media Studies has announced that it will remake its News University e-learning platform with $758,000 from the Knight Foundation . Poynter, which is based in St. Petersburg, Florida, said the funding will allow it to build a mobile-friendly platform that is more responsive to the needs of its audiences and promote the growth of talent, leadership and learning in journalism.\nThe plan marks the first major upgrade to News University in seven years, said Poynter, a journalism education and strategy center. News University is the world’s largest online journalism learning platform, it said.\n“The redesigned site will offer on-demand and mobile-tailored courses. It will apply digital training techniques using games, interactive hands-on practice and video,” said Poynter. The institute will also explore ways to integrate News University with its news site, making it easier for people to learn about its in-person, online and corporate training partnerships, as well as its in-depth coverage of the media industry.\nThrough the process, Poynter will further expand its teaching to non-journalists who would benefit from learning about writing, communication, leadership, critical thinking, audience development, social media and more.\n“By connecting the dots of Poynter’s expansive body of work to support excellence in journalism and democracy, Poynter will be the largest single resource for working journalists throughout their career,” said Poynter President Tim Franklin. “In today’s complex and evolving digital landscape, the demand for continuing education has never been greater. This new platform will allow Poynter to continue its tradition of innovation in journalism education.”\n“In the digital age, journalists are required to constantly update their skills and keep up with a fast-changing media landscape,” said Shazna Nessa, Knight Foundation director for journalism. “News University can be an essential partner in this goal.”\nThe foundation said that support for The Poynter Institute is part of its efforts to expand digital journalism training opportunities, support emerging leaders and strengthen the network of people working to advance the practice of journalism. Knight also supported a relaunch of the e-learning project in 2009 with $1.4 million, including the development of News University International.\nPoynter’s News University launched in 2005 with $2.8 million from the Knight Foundation. In the last 11 years, News University has served more than 370,000 people and offered 400 interactive course modules with training in seven languages. In 2015, class enrollments at NewsU reached a record of more than 102,000 people.\nThe John S. and James L.

{"text": "<p>As I mention in an earlier question, I'm refactoring a project I'm working on. Right now, everything depends on everything else. Everything is separated into namespaces I created early on, but I don't think my method of separtion was very good. I'm trying to eliminate cases where an object depends on another object in a different namespace that depends on the other object.</p>\n\n<p>The way I'm doing this, is by partitioning my project (a game) into a few assemblies:</p>\n\n<pre><code>GameName.Engine\nGameName.Rules\nGameName.Content\nGameName.Gui\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>GameName.Engine</code> assembly contains a bunch of interfaces, so other parts of the program don't need to depend on any particular implementation. For instance, I have a <code>GameName.Engine.ICarryable</code> interface that is primarily implemented by <code>GameName.Content.Item</code> class (and its sub-classes). I also have an object to allow an <code>Actor</code> to pick up an <code>ICarryable</code>: <code>PickupAction</code>. <code>Previously</code>, it required an Item, but this exposes unneccessary methods and properties, where it really only needed the methods required to pick it up and carry it. That's why I've created the <code>ICarryable</code> interface.</p>\n\n<p>Now that's all good, so to my question. <code>GameName.Gui</code> should only depend on <code>GameName.Engine</code>, not any implementation. Inside <code>GameName.Gui</code> I have a <code>MapView</code> object that displays a <code>Map</code> and any <code>IRenderable</code> objects on it.</p>\n\n<p><code>IRenderable</code> is basically just an interface that exposes an image and some strings describing the object. But, the MapView also needs the object to implement <code>ILocateable</code>, so it can see its location and know when it's changed via an event, <code>LocationChanged</code>, inside <code>ILocateable</code>.</p>\n\n<p>These two interfaces are implemented by both <code>Item</code> and <code>Actor</code> objects. Which, again are defined in <code>GameName.Content</code>. Since it needs both interfaces, I have two choices:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Make <code>GameName.Gui</code> depend on <code>GameName.Content</code> and require an <code>Entity</code> (base-class of <code>Item</code> and <code>Actor</code>).</p></li>\n<li><p>Make an interface inside <code>GameName.Engine</code> that looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>interface ILocateableRenderable : ILocateable, IRenderable\n{\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And then make my <code>Actor</code> and <code>Item</code> objects implement that interface instead of the two individually.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Anyone have any suggestions on which method is the best? Is it appropriate to create an interface with no methods or properties, that only enforces implementing two other interfaces?</p>\n\n<p><em>Clarification: <code>MapView</code> works on a <code>Map</code>, which is composed of <code>Entity</code> objects. I don't want to expose the <code>Entity</code> objects to the <code>MapView</code>, it only needs to know their location (<code>ILocateable</code>) and how to render them (<code>IRenderable</code>).</em></p>\n\n<p>You seem to have two conflicting requirements: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Inside GameName.Gui I\n  have a <strong>MapView object that displays</strong> a\n  Map and <strong>any IRenderable</strong> objects on it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But, the <strong>MapView also needs the object\n  to implement ILocateable</strong>, so it can\n  see its location and know when its\n  changed via an event, LocationChanged,\n  inside ILocateable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, if the MapView only needs IRenderable, then it should accept IRenderable and then check whether the class also implements ILocateable. In this case use its methods.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void Whatever(IRenderable renderable)\n{\n   if (renderable is ILocateable)\n   {\n      ((ILocateable) renderable).LocationChanged += myEventHandler;\n   }\n\n   // Do normal stuff\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>On the other hand, if you always need it to be ILocateable and IRenderable, then you should really create a derived interface in one of two ways\nEither</p>\n\n<pre><code>interface IMappable: IRenderable, ILocateable {}\n\npublic void Whatever(IMappable mappable)\n{\n   mappable.LocationChanged += myEventHandler;\n\n   // Do normal stuff\n}    \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or</p>\n\n<pre><code>interface IRenderable: ILocateable\n{\n  // IRenderable interface\n}\n\n\npublic void Whatever(IRenderable renderable)\n{\n   renderable.LocationChanged += myEventHandler;\n\n   // Do normal stuff\n}  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>depending on how your code is at the moment.</p>\n", "url": null}

{"text": "US Human Rights Report Whitewashes Israel’s Abuses Against Palestinians\n\nExpand The American and Israeli flags outside the U.S Embassy in Tel Aviv December 5, 2017. © 2017 Reuters\nThe US State Department’s newly released human rights report, designed to be a “factual resource” on human rights abuses in nearly 200 countries and to inform US foreign policy, has numerous problems and omissions – including with the chapters covering Israel and Palestine.\nThe problems start with the chapters’ names. In previous years, the State Department produced joint but separate chapters on “Israel” and “The Occupied Territories.” This year the State Department renamed the chapters “Israel and the Golan Heights” and the “West Bank and Gaza.” Additionally, the report almost entirely removes any reference to the occupation. Occupying powers have particular responsibilities under international humanitarian law and obscuring the nature of Israel’s control undermines efforts to hold Israel to these standards.\nAlso, the report goes even further than previous years in ceding to the Israeli government’s narrative on key issues. For example, last year’s report highlights “institutional and societal discrimination against Arab citizens of Israel” as among Israel’s “most significant human rights problems.” This is gone in this year’s report, a trend across many chapters of removing societal discrimination from the top line summaries.\nIn fact, the “Israel and the Golan Heights” chapter explicitly omits to mention Israel’s two-tiered discriminatory system in Jerusalem, where Israeli policy explicitly sets out as a goal “maintaining a solid Jewish majority in the city.” Instead, the report speaks of “Israeli residents of Jerusalem” – which presumably includes illegal Jewish settlers in East Jerusalem – explicitly leaving almost all mention of Palestinian residents in Jerusalem to the “West Bank and Gaza” chapter.\nThis year’s report also diverges from previous years by noting its drafters “sought and received input from the government of Israel (and, where relevant, the Palestinian Authority) with regard to allegations of human rights abuses.” Notably, this type of caveat or sourcing explanation does not appear in the chapters of other close US allies like Japan, the United Kingdom, France, or Germany.\nThe US has for decades failed to sufficiently use its leverage to pressure Israel’s government to end decades of repression, institutionalized discrimination, and systematic abuse of Palestinians’ rights. This year’s report, though, speaks to the shift under the Trump administration to further whitewashing of those abuses, even while acknowledging, at times, that abuses against Palestinians have been independently documented by groups like Human Rights Watch.\nFar from strengthening the US’s standing, turning a blind eye to reality only isolates the US from the international consensus around Israel’s abuses and makes its voice less credible and relevant.", "url": "https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/04/24/us-human-rights-report-whitewashes-israels-abuses-against-palestinians"}

{"text": "Machado to move from 3B to SS for Orioles, Showalter says\n\nBALTIMORE (AP) — Even if Manny Machado doesn't switch teams this season, he almost certainly will be changing his position in the infield.\nBaltimore Orioles manager Buck Showalter said Saturday that Machado will move from third base to shortstop this spring, and shortstop Tim Beckham will be shifted to third.\nThe shuffle will become permanent unless something goes wrong — or Machado gets traded to another club.\n\"There could be some adjustments if we don't like the feel of it, but that's where we're going to head into it,\" Showalter said at FanFest, an annual offseason event designed to promote interest in the club.\nMachado and second baseman Jonathan Schoop did not attend.\nMachado becomes a free agent after this year and is sure to demand a huge contract. The Orioles have entertained trade offers for the 25-year-old, who's been an All-Star in three of his six seasons with Baltimore.\nDan Duquette, vice president of baseball operations for the Orioles, has to decide whether to deal Machado sometime between now and September or seek to sign him to a long-term deal.\n\"That's a big decision for the organization, obviously,\" Duquette said. \"But we're planning on Manny being with the club. We explored all those options. We think the strongest option is for Manny to be on the ballclub.\"\nMachado played in 156 games last season, offsetting a career-low .259 batting average with 33 home runs and 95 RBIs. He has averaged 35 home runs and 92 RBIs over the past three years.\nMachado avoided arbitration this month by agreeing to a $16 million contract for 2018. He received $11.5 million last season.\nDrafted as a shortstop as the third overall pick in 2010, Machado played third base with Baltimore next to slick-fielding J.J. Hardy, whose contract expired after last season.\nSo when they return to the field next month in Florida, the Orioles will have Machado at shortstop with Beckham on his left. Beckham came to Baltimore from Tampa Bay in July and played shortstop for the injured Hardy over the final two months.\n\"I think Tim would rather play shortstop, as Manny would,\" Showalter said. \"Tim's big thing is getting an opportunity to play every day at one position. We need to settle both those guys into a spot and let them get into it.\"\nShowalter said Machado was enthusiastic about the switch.\n\"All indications are, he's really excited about this,\" Showalter said. \"I can't imagine him being in a better frame of mind or setup to do this. I think out of his respect for J.J. the past few years he's been very professional about it. But it's not like he's changing positions. He's going back to the position he's equipped to play.\"\nDeciding what to do with Machado is only one problem Duquette has faced this offseason. He's also been trying to fill out a starting rotation that currently consists of Dylan Bundy, Kevin Gausman and perhaps Miguel Castro, who made his first major league start on Sept. 30 after pitching in relief for 75 games over three seasons.\n\"Obviously we have work to do to address some of the deficiencies on our ballclub,\" Duquette said. \"We're going to continue to build our pitching staff, most notably the starting pitching.\"\nIf Castro joins the rotation, the Orioles will be further pressed to fill out the back end of the bullpen. Closer Zach Britton tore his Achilles tendon during an offseason workout and will likely miss the entire 2018 season, leaving setup man Brad Brach the odds-on favorite to take over as the stopper.\n\"I'm hoping I get a shot to close. I'd be lying if I say I didn't,\" said Brach, who served significant time as a closer in 2017 while Britton was sidelined with elbow and knee issues.\nBrach had 18 saves but blew six chances.\n\"I think I did all right,\" Brach said. \"Hopefully, I get another chance to do it.\"\n___\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball", "url": "https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3353775"}

Blige co-hosted the event.\nNEW YORK – More than 200 students gathered today (March 22) to get a taste of space directly from NASA and an astronaut in orbit.\n\"One of our greatest responsibilities at NASA is inspiring the next generation of explorers to work hard and pursue their dreams,\" Garver said. \"And it is my hope that some of those dreams include careers in science and engineering.\"\nThe students were also treated to a special appearance by astronaut Cady Coleman, who is currently orbiting 226 miles (363 kilometers) above Earth on the International Space Station. Coleman answered questions from the audience via satellite video link about life in space, and encouraged all the youngsters to work hard and follow their dreams.\n\"When you're thinking about what you'd like to be, you can be anything,\" Coleman said. \"I sincerely believe that. And you don't have to know what it is yet, but this is the time to get ready. By coming to an event like this, you're getting ready.\"\nToday's event was part of a collaboration between NASA, fashion designer Donna Karan's Urban Zen Foundation, and the Foundation for Advancing Women Now (FFAWN), which is an outreach charity created by R&B recording artist Mary J. Blige.\nMelvin spoke about the value of these collaborations and the importance of promoting science, technology, engineering and mathematics – the so-called STEM subjects.\n\"The primary focus of NASA's education mission is to use the excitement and wonder of our programs to ignite a spark for all students to follow STEM studies that can lead to exciting career options,\" Melvin said. \"By collaborating with organizations like Urban Zen and FFAWN, whose missions are aligned with ours, we can identify and reach out to students who may not otherwise realize the opportunities that are available. That's important to me and to the agency.\"\nBlige's FFAWN foundation previously teamed up with NASA's Summer of Innovation project to encourage young women to pursue STEM studies, and to demonstrate career possibilities in these fields.\nThe students at today's forum represented the Women's Academy of Excellence, the Promise Academy, the New York City Housing Authority, and the General D. Chappie James Middle School of Science.", "url": "https://www.space.com/11199-nasa-space-exploration-education-newyork.html"}

{"text": "This is the first of a three-part series on Intel Micron unveil new 3D XPoint Non Volatie Memory NVM for servers storage announcement. Read Part II here and Part III here.\nIn a webcast the other day, Intel and Micron announced new 3D XPoint non-volatile memory (NVM) that can be used for both primary main memory (e.g. what’s in computers, serves, laptops, tablets and many other things) in place of Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), for persistent storage faster than today’s NAND flash-based solid state devices (SSD), not to mention future hybrid usage scenarios. Note that this announcement while having the common term 3D in it is different from the earlier Intel and Micron announcement about 3D NAND flash (read more about that here).\nWhat did Intel and Micron announce?\nIntel SVP and General Manager Non-Volatile Memory solutions group Robert Crooke (Left) and Micron CEO D. Mark Durcan did the joint announcement presentation of 3D XPoint (webinar here). What was announced is the 3D XPoint technology jointly developed and manufactured by Intel and Micron which is a new form or category of NVM that can be used for both primary memory in servers, laptops, other computers among other uses, as well as for persistent data storage.\nWhat applications and products is 3D XPoint suited for?\nIn general, 3D XPoint should be able to be used for many of the same applications and associated products that current DRAM and NAND flash-based storage memories are used for. These range from IT and cloud or managed service provider data centers based applications and services, as well as consumer focused among many others.\nIn general, applications or usage scenarios along with supporting products that can benefit from 3D XPoint include among others’. Applications that need larger amounts of main memory in a denser footprint such as in-memory databases, little and big data analytics, gaming, wave form analysis for security, copyright or other detection analysis, life sciences, high performance compute and high-productivity compute, energy, video and content severing among many others.\nIn addition, applications that need persistent main memory for resiliency, or to cut delays and impacts for planned or un-planned maintenance or having to wait for memories and caches to be warmed or re-populated after a server boot (or re-boot). 3D XPoint will also be useful for those applications that need faster read and write performance compared to current generations NAND flash for data storage. This means both existing and emerging applications as well as some that do not yet exist will benefit from 3D XPoint over time, like how today’s applications and others have benefited from DRAM used in Dual Inline Memory Module (DIMM) and NAND flash advances over the past several decades.\nFirst, keep in mind that this is very early in the 3D XPoint technology evolution life-cycle and both DRAM and NAND flash will not be dead at least near term. Keep in mind that NAND flash appeared back in 1989 and only over the past several years has finally hit its mainstream adoption stride with plenty of market upside left. Continue reading Part II here and Part III here of this three-part series on Intel and Micron 3D XPoint along with more analysis and commentary.", "url": "https://storageioblog.com/intel-micron-unveil-new-3d-xpoint-nvm-for-servers-storage/"}

{"text": "British Virgin Islands\n\nThe British Virgin Islands (BVI), officially the Virgin Islands, is a British Overseas Territory in the Caribbean, to the east of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands and north-west of Anguilla. The islands are geographically part of the Virgin Islands archipelago and are located in the Leeward Islands of the Lesser Antilles and part of the West Indies.\n\nThe British Virgin Islands consist of the main islands of Tortola, Virgin Gorda, Anegada and Jost Van Dyke, along with more than 50 other smaller islands and cays. About 16 of the islands are inhabited. The capital, Road Town, is on Tortola, the largest island, which is about  long and  wide. The islands had a population of 28,054 at the 2010 Census, of whom 23,491 lived on Tortola; current estimates put the population at 35,802 (July 2018).\n\nBritish Virgin Islanders are British Overseas Territories citizens and since 2002, are also British citizens.\n\nEtymology\nThe islands were named \"Santa Úrsula y las Once Mil Vírgenes\" by Christopher Columbus in 1493 after the legend of Saint Ursula and the 11,000 virgins. The name was later shortened to \"the Virgin Islands\".\n\nThe official name of the territory is still simply the \"Virgin Islands\", but the prefix \"British\" is often used. This is commonly believed to distinguish it from the neighbouring American territory which changed its name from the \"Danish West Indies\" to \"Virgin Islands of the United States\" in 1917. However, local historians have disputed this, pointing to a variety of publications and public records dating from between 21 February 1857 and 12 September 1919 where the territory is referred to as the British Virgin Islands. British Virgin Islands government publications continue to begin with the name \"The territory of the Virgin Islands\", and the territory's passports simply refer to the \"Virgin Islands\", and all laws begin with the words \"Virgin Islands\". Moreover, the territory's Constitutional Commission has expressed the view that \"every effort should be made\" to encourage the use of the name \"Virgin Islands\". But various public and quasi-public bodies continue to use the name \"British Virgin Islands\" or \"BVI\", including BVI Finance, BVI Electricity Corporation, BVI Tourist Board, BVI Athletic Association, BVI Bar Association and others.\n\nIn 1968 the British Government issued a memorandum requiring that the postage stamps in the territory should say \"British Virgin Islands\" (whereas previously they had simply stated \"Virgin Islands\"), a practice which is still followed today. This was likely to prevent confusion following on from the adoption of US currency in the territory in 1959, and the references to US currency on the stamps of the territory.\n\nHistory\n\nIt is generally thought that the Virgin Islands were first settled by the Arawak from South America around 100 BC to AD 200, though there is some evidence of Amerindian presence on the islands as far back as 1500 BC. The Arawaks inhabited the islands until the 15th century when they were displaced by the more aggressive Caribs, a tribe from the Lesser Antilles islands.\n\nThe first European sighting of the Virgin Islands was by the Spanish expedition of Christopher Columbus in 1493 on his second voyage to the Americas, who gave the islands their modern name.\n\nThe Spanish Empire claimed the islands by discovery in the early 16th century, but never settled them, and subsequent years saw the English, Dutch, French, Spanish, and Danish all jostling for control of the region, which became a notorious haunt for pirates. There is no record of any native Amerindian population in the British Virgin Islands during this period; it is thought that they either fled to safer islands or were killed.\n\nThe Dutch established a permanent settlement on the island of Tortola by 1648, frequently clashing with the Spanish who were based on nearby Puerto Rico. In 1672, the English captured Tortola from the Dutch, and the English annexation of Anegada and Virgin Gorda followed in 1680. Meanwhile, over the period 1672–1733, the Danish gained control of the nearby islands of Saint Thomas, Saint John and Saint Croix (i.e. the modern US Virgin Islands).\n\nThe British islands were considered principally a strategic possession. The British introduced sugar cane which was to become the main crop and source of foreign trade, and large numbers of slaves were forcibly brought from Africa to work on the sugar cane plantations. The islands prospered economically until the middle of the nineteenth century, when a combination of the abolition of slavery in the British Empire in 1834, a series of disastrous hurricanes, and the growth in the sugar beet crop in Europe and the United States significantly reduced sugar cane production and led to a period of economic decline.\n\nIn 1917, the United States purchased the Danish Virgin Islands for US$25 million, renaming them the United States Virgin Islands. Economic linkages with the US islands prompted the British Virgin Islands to adopt the US dollar as its currency in 1959.\n\nThe British Virgin Islands were administered variously as part of the British Leeward Islands or with St. Kitts and Nevis, with an administrator representing the British Government on the islands. The islands gained separate colony status in 1960 and became autonomous in 1967 under the new post of Chief Minister. Since the 1960s, the islands have diversified away from their traditionally agriculture-based economy towards tourism and financial services, becoming one of the wealthiest areas in the Caribbean. The constitution of the islands was amended in 1977, 2004 and 2007, giving them greater local autonomy.\n\nIn 2017 Hurricane Irma struck the islands, causing four deaths and immense damage.\n\nGeography\n\nThe British Virgin Islands comprise around 60 tropical Caribbean islands, ranging in size from the largest, Tortola, being  long and  wide, to tiny uninhabited islets, altogether about  in extent. They are located in the Virgin Islands archipelago, a few miles east of the US Virgin Islands, and about  from the Puerto Rican mainland. About  east south-east lies Anguilla. The North Atlantic Ocean lies to the east of the islands, and the Caribbean Sea lies to the west. Most of the islands are volcanic in origin and have a hilly, rugged terrain. The highest point is Mount Sage on Tortola at 521m. Anegada is geologically distinct from the rest of the group, being a flat island composed of limestone and coral. The British Virgin Islands contain the Leeward Islands moist forests and Leeward Islands xeric scrub terrestrial ecoregions.\n\nClimate\n\nThe British Virgin Islands have a tropical rainforest climate, moderated by trade winds. Temperatures vary little throughout the year. In the capital, Road Town, typical daily maxima are around  in the summer and  in the winter. Typical daily minima are around  in the summer and  in the winter. Rainfall averages about  per year, higher in the hills and lower on the coast. Rainfall can be quite variable, but the wettest months on average are September to November and the driest months on average are February and March.\n\nHurricanes\nHurricanes occasionally hit the islands, with the Atlantic hurricane season running from June to November.\n\nHurricane Irma\n\nOn 6 September 2017, Hurricane Irma struck the islands, causing extensive damage, especially on Tortola, and killing four people. The Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency declared a state of emergency. Visiting Tortola on 13 September 2017, UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said that he was reminded of photos of Hiroshima after it had been hit by the atom bomb.\n\nBy 8 September, the UK government sent troops with medical supplies and other aid. More troops were expected to arrive a day or two later, but\n, carrying more extensive assistance, was not expected to reach the islands for another two weeks.\n\nEntrepreneur Richard Branson, a resident of Necker Island, called on the UK government to develop a massive disaster recovery plan to include \"both through short-term aid and long-term infrastructure spending\". Premier Orlando Smith also called for a comprehensive aid package to rebuild the territory. On 10 September UK Prime Minister Theresa May pledged £32 million to the Caribbean for a hurricane relief fund and promised that the UK government would match donations from the public to the British Red Cross appeal. Specifics were not provided to the news media as to the amount that would be allocated to the Virgin Islands. Boris Johnson's visit to Tortola on 13 September 2017 during his Caribbean tour was intended to confirm the UK's commitment to helping restore British islands but he provided no additional comments on the aid package. He did confirm that HMS Ocean had departed for the BVI carrying items like timber, buckets, bottled water, food, baby milk, bedding and clothing, as well as ten pickup trucks, building materials and hardware.\n\nThe UK offered to underwrite rebuilding loans up to US$400m as long as there was accountability as to how the monies were spent. Successive NDP and VIP governments declined, despite there having been created a Recovery & Development Authority led by highly skilled infrastructure personnel, many of whom were ex-military with decades of infrastructure rebuilding expertise from war zones and natural disaster sites. Many wealthy residents also proposed a large rebuilding plan, starting with key infrastructure, such as the high school. Nearly five years later, there was no sign of any such rebuilding of the high school or certain other key infrastructure.\n\nPolitics\n\nThe territory operates as a parliamentary democracy. Ultimate executive authority in the British Virgin Islands is vested in the King, and is exercised on his behalf by the Governor of the British Virgin Islands. The governor is appointed by the King on the advice of the British Government. Defence and most foreign affairs remain the responsibility of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe most recent constitution was adopted in 2007 (the Virgin Islands Constitution Order, 2007) and came into force when the Legislative Council was dissolved for the 2007 general election. The head of government under the constitution is the Premier (before the new constitution the office was referred to as Chief Minister), who is elected in a general election along with the other members of the ruling government as well as the members of the opposition. Elections are held roughly every four years. A cabinet is nominated by the Premier and appointed and chaired by the Governor. The Legislature consists of the King (represented by the Governor) and a unicameral House of Assembly made up of 13 elected members plus the Speaker and the Attorney General.\n\t\nThe current Governor is John Rankin (since 29 January 2020). The current Premier is Natalio Wheatley (since 5 May 2022), who is leader of the Virgin Islands Party.\n\nOn 8 June 2022, subordinate UK legislation was made allowing for direct rule for the islands. However, the British Government decided on that date not to implement direct rule.\n\nSubdivisions\n\nThe British Virgin Islands is a unitary territory. The territory is divided into nine electoral districts, and each voter is registered in one of those districts. Eight of the nine districts are partly or wholly on Tortola, and encompass nearby neighbouring islands. Only the ninth district (Virgin Gorda and Anegada) does not include any part of Tortola. At elections, in addition to voting their local representative, voters also cast votes for four \"at-large\" candidates who are elected upon a territory-wide basis.\n\nThe territory is also technically divided into five administrative districts (one for each of the four largest islands, with the fifth covering all other islands), and into six civil registry districts (three for Tortola, Jost Van Dyke, Virgin Gorda and Anegada) although these have little practical relevance.\n\nLaw and criminal justice\n\nCrime in the British Virgin Islands is comparatively low by Caribbean standards. Whilst statistics and hard data are relatively rare, and are not regularly published by governmental sources in the British Virgin Islands, the Premier did announce that in 2013 there has been a 14% decline in recorded crime as against 2012. Homicides are rare, with just one incident recorded in 2013.\n\nThe Virgin Islands Prison Service operates a single facility, His Majesty's Prison in East End, Tortola.\n\nThe British and US Virgin Islands sit at the axis of a major drugs transshipment point between Latin America and the continental United States. The American Drug Enforcement Administration regards the adjacent US territories of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands as a \"High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area\". A co-operation agreement exists between the British Virgin Islands and the US Coast Guard allowing American forces to pursue suspected drug traffickers through the territorial waters of the British Virgin Islands. In August 2011 a joint raid between the American DEA and the Royal Virgin Islands Police Force arrested a number of British Virgin Islands residents who are accused of being involved in major drugs transshipments, although their extradition to the United States has since become stalled in protracted legal wrangling.\n\nMilitary\n\nAs a British Overseas territory, defence of the islands is the responsibility of the United Kingdom.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe twin pillars of the economy are financial services (60%) and tourism (roughly 40-45% of GDP). Politically, tourism is the more important of the two, as it employs a greater number of people within the territory, and a larger proportion of the businesses in the tourist industry are locally owned, as are a number of the highly tourism-dependent sole traders (for example, taxi drivers and street vendors).\n\nEconomically however, financial services associated with the territory's status as an offshore financial centre are by far the more important. 51.8% of the Government's revenue comes directly from licence fees for offshore companies, and considerable further sums are raised directly or indirectly from payroll taxes relating to salaries paid within the trust industry sector (which tend to be higher on average than those paid in the tourism sector).\n\nThe official currency of the British Virgin Islands has been the United States dollar (US$) since 1959, the currency also used by the United States Virgin Islands.\n\nThe British Virgin Islands enjoys one of the more prosperous economies of the Caribbean region, with a per capita average income of around $42,300 (2010 est.) The average monthly income earned by a worker in the territory was US$2,452 as at the time of the 2010 Census. 29% of the population fell into the \"low income\" category.\n\nAlthough it is common to hear criticism in the British Virgin Islands' press about income inequality, no serious attempt has been made by economists to calculate a Gini coefficient or similar measure of income equality for the territory. A report from 2000 suggested that, despite the popular perception, income inequality was actually lower in the British Virgin Islands than in any other OECS state, although in global terms income equality is higher in the Caribbean than in many other regions.\n\nTourism\n\nTourism accounts for approximately 45% of national income. The islands are a popular destination for US citizens. Tourists frequent the numerous white sand beaches, visit The Baths on Virgin Gorda, snorkel the coral reefs near Anegada, or experience the well-known bars of Jost Van Dyke. The BVI are known as one of the world's greatest sailing destinations, and charter sailboats are a very popular way to visit less accessible islands. Established in 1972, the BVI hosts the BVI Spring Regatta and Sailing Festival. A substantial number of the tourists who visit the BVI are cruise ship passengers, and although they produce far lower revenue per head than charter boat tourists and hotel based tourists, they are nonetheless important to the substantial - and politically important - taxi driving community. Only Virgin Islanders are permitted to work as taxi drivers.\n\nFinancial services\nFinancial services account for over half of the income of the territory. The majority of this revenue is generated by the licensing of offshore companies and related services. The British Virgin Islands is a significant global player in the offshore financial services industry. Since 2001, financial services in the British Virgin Islands have been regulated by the independent Financial Services Commission.\n\nThe BVI is relied upon for its sophisticated Commercial Court division of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court, as well as the more recent BVI Arbitration Centre. Caribbean KCs and British KCs preside over the majority of important cases and the laws of the Virgin Islands are based on English laws, meaning the jurisdiction provides clarity and consistency should parties require commercial disputes to be resolved. Owing to the international nature of BVI companies' operations and asset holdings, the BVI Commercial Court routinely hears highly sophisticated matters at the cutting edge of cross-border litigation and enforcement, where billions of dollars are at issue.\n\nCitco, also known as the Citco Group of Companies and the Curaçao International Trust Co., is a privately owned global hedge fund administrator headquartered in the British Virgin Islands, founded in 1948. It is the world's largest hedge fund administrator, managing over $1 trillion in assets under administration.\n\nIn May 2022, the banking sector of the British Virgin Islands comprised only seven commercial banks and one restricted bank, 12 authorised custodians, two licensed money services businesses and one licensed financing service provider.\n\nThe British Virgin Islands is frequently referred to as a \"tax haven\" by campaigners and NGOs, including Oxfam, which itself has investment funds registered in lesser regulated jurisdictions such as Lichtenstein and Delaware  and has been expressly named in anti-tax-haven legislation in other countries on various occasions. Successive governments in the British Virgin Islands have implemented tax exchange agreements and verified beneficial ownership information of companies following the 2013 G8 summit putting their governance and regulatory regimes far ahead of many \"onshore\" jurisdictions. \n\nOn 10 September 2013, British Prime Minister David Cameron said \"I do not think it is fair any longer to refer to any of the Overseas Territories or Crown Dependencies as tax havens. They have taken action to make sure that they have fair and open tax systems. It is very important that our focus should now shift to those territories and countries that really are tax havens.\" Yet journalist and author for The Economist, Nicholas Shaxson, writes in his 2016 Treasure Islands, tax havens and the men who stole the world: \"...Britain sits, spider-like, at the centre of a vast international web of tax havens, which hoover up trillions of dollars' worth of business and capital from around the globe and funnel it up to the City of London.  The British Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories - ...the British Virgin Islands... are some of the biggest players in the offshore world.\"(pp. vii-viii) Shaxson points out that despite BVI having fewer than 25000 inhabitants, hosts over 800,000 companies.\n\nIn the April 2016 Panama Papers leak, while all of the wrongdoing by Mossack Fonseca personnel occurred in Panama and the US, the British Virgin Islands was by far the most commonly-used jurisdiction by clients of Mossack Fonseca.\n\nIn 2022, the verified nature of beneficial ownership registers of the British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies were a crucial tool in giving effect to sanctions against Russia and Belarus, enabling the efficient identification and seizure of yachts, real estate and businesses.\n\nForeign Account Tax Compliance Act\nOn 30 June 2014, The British Virgin Islands was deemed to have an Inter- Governmental Agreement (IGA) with the United States of America with respect to the \"Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act\" of the United States of America.\n\nThe Model 1 Agreement (14 Pages) recognizes that: The Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland provided a copy of the Letter of Entrustment which was sent to the Government of the British Virgin Islands, to the Government of the United States of America \"via diplomatic note of 28 May 2014\".\n\nThe Letter of Entrustment dated 14 July 2010 was originally provided to the Government of the British Virgin Islands and authorised the Government of the BVI \"to negotiate and conclude Agreements relating to taxation that provide for exchange of information on tax matters to the OECD standard\" (Paragraph 2 of the FATCA Agreement). Via an \"Entrustment Letter\" dated 24 March 2014, The Government of the United Kingdom, authorised the Government of the BVI to sign an agreement on information exchange to facilitate the Implementation of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act. On 27 March 2017, the US Treasury site disclosed that the Model 1 agreement and related agreement were \"In Force\" on 13 July 2015.\n\nSanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act\nUnder the UK Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2018, beneficial ownership of companies in British overseas territories such as the British Virgin Islands must be publicly registered for disclosure by 31 December 2020. The Government of the British Virgin Islands has not yet formally challenged this law, yet has criticised it, noting that it violates the Constitutional sovereignty granted to the islands, and would in practice be relatively ineffective in anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing, while raising serious privacy and human rights issues. Further, this would put the British Virgin Islands in a position where it would be at a severe disadvantage because other International Finance Centres do not have this in place, and in the case of the US and the UK, there is very little near-term prospect of the same. \n\nIn late 2022, both of the USA and EU appeared to have endorsed the British Overseas Territories' beneficial ownership register regimes.  In a judgment dated 22 November 2022, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has at last decided that open public access to the beneficial owner registers of EU member state companies is no longer valid, as it is in contravention of articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the Charter). The USA appears to have come to a similar conclusion regarding balancing confidentiality and legitimate privacy with the Anti-Money Laundering advantages of having verified beneficial ownerships registers. The resultant goal appears to be to bring the USA in line with the current Cayman and BVI regimes. The UK's Crown Dependencies have already stated that they will not implement public registers without beforehand having received fresh legal advice on the matter and it is thought that the Overseas Territories would logically take a similar position. The UK is yet to come out in support of the BOTs and CDs and their current gold standard regulatory positions.\n\nAgriculture and industry\nAgriculture and industry account for only a small proportion of the islands' GDP. Agricultural produce includes fruit, vegetables, sugar cane, livestock and poultry, and industries include rum distillation, construction and boat building. Commercial fishing is also practised in the islands' waters.\n\nWorkforce\nThe British Virgin Islands is heavily dependent on migrant workers, and over 50% of all workers on the islands are of a foreign descent. Only 37% of the entire population were born in the territory. The national labour-force is estimated at 12,770, of whom approximately 59.4% work in the service sector but less than 0.6% are estimated to work in agriculture (the balance working in industry). The British Virgin Islands has met challenges in recruiting sufficient numbers in recent years, having been affected by hurricanes Irma and Maria, and having continued to lag behind other jurisdictions in providing a reliable permanent residence regime. This has had a knock-on effect in limiting schooling and amenities when compared to IFCs like Cayman, UAE, Singapore, and Hong Kong.\n\nCARICOM status and the CARICOM Single Market Economy\nAs of 2 July 1991, the British Virgin Islands holds Associate Member status in CARICOM, the Caribbean Single Market and Economy (CSME).\n\nIn recognition of the CARICOM (Free Movement) Skilled Persons Act which came into effect in July 1997 in some of the CARICOM countries such as Jamaica and which has been adopted in other CARICOM countries, such as Trinidad and Tobago, it is possible that CARICOM nationals who hold the \"A Certificate of Recognition of Caribbean Community Skilled Person\" may be allowed to work in the BVI under normal working conditions.\n\nTransport\n\nThere are  of roads. The main airport, Terrance B. Lettsome International Airport, also known as Beef Island Airport, is located on Beef Island, which lies off the eastern tip of Tortola and is accessible by the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge. Cape Air, and Air Sunshine are among the airlines offering scheduled service. Virgin Gorda and Anegada have their own smaller airports. Private air charter services operated by Island Birds Air Charter fly directly to all three islands from any major airport in the Caribbean. Helicopters are used to get to islands with no runway facilities; Antilles Helicopter Services is the only helicopter service based in the country.\n\nThe main harbour is in Road Town. There are also ferries that operate within the British Virgin Islands and to the neighbouring United States Virgin Islands. Cars in the British Virgin Islands drive on the left just as they do in the United Kingdom and the United States Virgin Islands. However, most cars are left hand drive, because they are from the United States. The roads are often quite steep, narrow and winding, and ruts, mudslides and rockfall can be a problem when it rains.\n\nDemographics\n\nAs of the 2010 Census, the population of the territory was 28,054. Estimates put the population at 35,800 (July 2018) yet in 2022, it is thought to be much less than 30,000 post-Irma and  with people having left during COVID lockdowns due to unemployment in the tourism industry. The majority of the population (76.9%) are Afro-Caribbean, descended from slaves brought to the islands by the British. Other large ethnic groups include Latinos (5.6%), those of European ancestry (5.4%), Mixed ancestry (5.4%) and Indian (2.1%).\n\nThe 2010 Census reports:\n76.9% African\n5.6% Hispanic\n5.4% European/Caucasian\n5.4% Mixed\n2.1% East Indian\n4.6% Others*\n\nThe 2010 Census reports the main places of origin of residents as follows:\n39.1% local born (though many locals go to St. Thomas or the United States for maternity services)\n7.2% Guyana\n7.0% St. Vincent and the Grenadines\n6.0% Jamaica\n5.5% United States\n5.4% Dominican Republic\n5.3% United States Virgin Islands\n\nThe islands are heavily dependent upon migrant labour. In 2004, migrant workers accounted for 50% of the total population. 32% of workers employed in the British Virgin Islands work for the government. In the late 2000s the first Overseas Filipino Worker came to the British Virgin Islands, by 2020 total British Filipino population was about 800.\n\nUnusually, the territory has one of the highest drowning mortality rates in the world, being higher than other high-risk countries such as China and India. 20% of deaths in the British Virgin Islands during 2012 were recorded as drownings, all of them being tourists. Despite this, the territory's most popular beach still has no lifeguard presence.\n\nReligion\n\nOver 90% of the population who indicated a religious affiliation at the 2010 Census were Christian with the largest individual Christian denominations being Methodist (17.6%), Anglican (9.5%), Church of God (10.4%), Seventh-Day Adventists (9.0%) and Roman Catholic (8.9%).  The largest non-Christian faiths in 2010 were Hinduism (1.9%) and Islam (0.9%).  However Hindus and Muslims constitute each approximately 1.2% of the population according to Word Religion Database 2005.\n\nThe Constitution of the British Virgin Islands commences with a professed national belief in God.\n\nEducation\n\nThe British Virgin Islands operates several government schools as well as private schools. There is also a community college, H. Lavity Stoutt Community College, that is located on the eastern end of Tortola. This college was named after Lavity Stoutt, the first Chief Minister of the British Virgin Islands. There remains segregation in the school system; while BVIslander and Belonger children make up a significant proportion of pupils in private schools, Non-Belongers are prohibited from attending government schools. It is extremely common for students from the British Virgin Islands to travel overseas for secondary and tertiary education, either to the University of the West Indies, or to colleges and universities in either the United Kingdom, United States or Canada. Coaching in certain sports, such as athletics, squash and football is of a high level.\n\nThe literacy rate in the British Virgin Islands is high at 98%.\n\nThere is a University of the West Indies Open campus in the territory and a Marine Science educational facility.\n\nCulture\n\nLanguage\n\nThe primary language is English, although there is a local dialect. Spanish is spoken by Puerto Rican, Dominican and other Hispanic immigrants.\n\nMusic\n\nThe traditional music of the British Virgin Islands is called fungi after the local cornmeal dish with the same name, often made with okra. The special sound of fungi is due to a unique local fusion between African and European music. It functions as a medium of local history and folklore and is therefore a cherished cultural form of expression that is part of the curriculum in BVI schools. The fungi bands, also called \"scratch bands\", use instruments ranging from calabash, washboard, bongos and ukulele, to more traditional western instruments like keyboard, banjo, guitar, bass, triangle and saxophone. Apart from being a form of festive dance music, fungi often contains humorous social commentaries, as well as BVI oral history.\n\nSport\n\nBecause of its location and climate, the British Virgin Islands has long been a haven for sailing enthusiasts. Sailing is regarded as one of the foremost sports in all of the BVI. Calm waters and steady breezes provide some of the best sailing conditions in the Caribbean.\n\nMany sailing events are held in the waters of this country, the largest of which is a week-long series of races called the Spring Regatta, the premier sailing event of the Caribbean, with several races hosted each day. Boats include everything from full-size mono-hull yachts to dinghies. Captains and their crews come from all around the world to attend these races. The Spring Regatta is part race, part party, part festival. The Spring Regatta is normally held during the first week of April.\n\nSince 2009, the BVI have made a name for themselves as a host of international basketball events. The BVI hosted three of the last four events of the Caribbean Basketball Championship (FIBA CBC Championship).\n\nSee also\n\nList of British Virgin Islanders\nOutline of the British Virgin Islands\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Directories\nBritish Virgin Islands from UCB Libraries GovPubs\n\nBritish Virgin Islands Guide from The Moorings\n\n NGO sources\n\n Official websites and overviews\nGovernment of the British Virgin Islands official website\nBritish Virgin Islands - London Office\nOld Government House Museum, British Virgin Islands\nBritish Virgin Islands Tourist Board\nHome\nNational Parks Trust of the British Virgin Islands—Official site\nBritish Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission—Official site\nThe British Virgin Islands Ports Authority—Official site\nBritish Virgin Islands.

Die EU-Finanzminister in Brüssel konnten sich nicht auf eine gemeinsame Position einigen.\nDie EU-Kommission hatte vorgeschlagen, für große Digitalunternehmen mit einem weltweiten Jahresumsatz von mindestens 750 Millionen Euro sowie einem Online-Umsatz von 50 Millionen Euro drei Prozent Ertragssteuer zu erheben. Schätzungen zufolge zahlen Digitalfirmen nur halb so viele Steuern wie klassische Unternehmen, da sie oftmals keine versteuerbaren Firmensitze haben oder ihre Geschäfte in Ländern mit günstigen Bedingungen bündeln. EU-Beschlüsse in Steuerfragen müssen einstimmig getroffen werden. Das macht Einigungen besonders schwierig.\nEin „schwacher und verwässerter Vorschlag“\nDeutschland und Frankreich plädierten für eine abgespeckte Digitalsteuer. Eine Drei-Prozent-Umsatzsteuer lediglich auf Online-Werbeerlöse solle bis März 2019 beschlossen werden, hieß es. Sie solle dann ab Januar 2021 gelten. Ursprünglich sollte mit der Digitalsteuer jedoch nicht nur Online-Werbung besteuert werden, sondern auch der Verkauf von Nutzerdaten.\nDer Vorstoß greife zu kurz, kritisierte nun Spaniens Ministerin Nadia Calviño. Es müsse sichergestellt werden, dass Digitalfirmen fair besteuert würden. „Ich habe ernsthafte Bedenken“, sagte Finnlands Finanzminister Petteri Orpo. Auch Irland – wo Facebook seinen Europasitz hat – steht der Digitalsteuer grundsätzlich kritisch gegenüber.\n„Deutschlands und Frankreichs schwacher und verwässerter Vorschlag wird die meisten Tech-Giganten aus der Verantwortung nehmen“, kritisierte auch die Entwicklungsorganisation Oxfam. Dies sei ein Rückschlag im Kampf um Steuergerechtigkeit.", "url": "https://de.euronews.com/2018/12/04/digitalsteuer-in-der-eu-kommission-gescheitert"}

I will try to check on port days, if /when we can find free wifi.\nAre you doing the road to Hana? We really liked that when we went to maui, as well as sunrise on top of the volcano.\nNot to derail too much, so briefly...we've been up top on a prior trip though not at sunrise. And we haven't done that road.\nWe've been to each of the main islands and I think we like Maui the most.\nWell done retiring oracles, and good luck to the candidates The names already mentioned all makes sense!\n@SD08, thank you for the nomination, a wonderful surprise to me, to be nominated. Also thanks to the others who have supported your suggested nominees, as @srlawren and @mimmo are great company to be nominated with. With the continued expression of Bravos on my Open Letter earlier this year, I think I’ve shown a great deal of honest suggestion and feedback, and I continue to do so.\nTo @Rockdaddy22 and @imm1304, a long time job well done for the both of you.\n@SD08, I submit your name as a nominee, along with @wetcoaster also.\nThere are a number of well deserving nominees, and quite possibly more just coming along. I do hope those chosen are welcomed and accepted by all, and the Community will I’m sure continue to grow, and be the wonderful place I choose to spend a few too many hours each week.\nThanks to @imm1304 and @Rockdaddy22 and all Oracles for there support.\nDefinitely a big loss for the PM community, @imm1304 and @Rockdaddy22 you will both be surely missed as community helpers.\nAlthough we lost a couple great one's there are definitely a number of amazing folks out there that people have already mentioned. And these folks do an amazing job providing solutions, keeping it real, and calling out those who may have it all wrong (like myself). If these folks are interested in putting their names in the Oracle search hat I would definitely give them my vote (not that my vote means anything but hey why not).\nI think everyone listed above are superstars in this community and would provide an amazing bonus as Oracles in the PM Community. I know I'm missing a few others but that's all who I can think of right now.\nLots of good choices available. My top nominee would be @srlawren without a doubt, if he's interested!\n@ShawnC13My original comment is relevant to this discussion and should be here please do not remove my on topic response to @Alan_K's announcement regarding my nomination and sharing my appriciation for 2 people that were legends in their time.\n@Alan_K wrote: interested in providing honest feedback about how we are doing.\nhttps://productioncommunity.publicmobile.ca/t5/Announcements/The-Oracles-are-here/td-p/46853 \"Every three months, we’ll look at the Community’s most active members and consider them for the Oracle program. Here are some tips to help you get noticed:\"... But following the tips did nothing.\nWhen public mobile was unable to do what they said with public labs (which was the best thing ever imo), they shut it down hard. Well... public mobile fell asleep on the oracle program, so clearly its time to rethink how one is held in such regard. I am just spitballing here but maybe let a \"magic formula\" decide each month or two, to give a fair playing field for anyone. Or let the community decide. Maybe drop the lowest performing oracle each month. Something needs to be done. We need a change. This would also give you an extremely diverse suggestion base.\nDiversity is what we need. Having the same people, give the same macro response is ok but you asked for \"passionate\". Sorry to say but the \"passion\" doesn't last forever and you need to take advantage of those that have passion while they still do. Because everyone loses steam sooner or later. The ones that have passion go unnoticed, the ones that had passion fade away and Simon the script bot might as well be an oracle.\nDoes anyone remember @LEGO ? I wonder if she would still be here if she ever got to touch the position I believe she would have earned. This may motivate not only the oracles that are fading away but may motivate others to see that something is actually possible to achieve.\nBoth @imm1304 and @Rockdaddy22 were incredible contributors for their time and that should not go unrecognized.

{"text": "Spaniards wait on next move from Newcastle on defender\n\nEibar are waiting on Newcastle United’s next move in their pursuit of Florian Lejeune.\nThe Magpies are ready to exploit Lejeune’s £8.7million release clause.\nLejeune – who left Manchester City last summer – has been earmarked as a potential defensive recruit, with boss Rafa Benitez keen to strengthen his defence ahead of Newcastle’s return to the Premier League.\nParis-born Lejeune – who had a spell at Villarreal earlier in his career – signed a four-year deal at Eibar last summer after leaving City and impressed last season, when his team finished 10th in La Liga.\nEibar sporting director Fran Garagarza told Marca: “I’m not very optimistic. I see it difficult for Lejeune to stay.\n“We are worried that Newcastle are taking very strong steps.”\nNewcastle could force through a deal in the coming days, with Benitez keen to see a number of new faces arrive before his squad reports back for the start of pre-season training on July 3.\nMeanwhile, the Premier League fixtures were unveiled yesterday, with Championship champions Newcastle handed a home opener against star-studded Tottenham, scheduled for Saturday, August 12, although it could well be chosen for live TV coverage.\nSpurs were the last side the Magpies played in their last top-flight campaign, winning 5-1 at St James’s Park on the final day of 2015-16.\nBenitez said: “It’s a great start at home to Tottenham, and a really exciting first game at St James’s Park for our fans to enjoy.\n“We will all have extra motivation for that game.\n“But it will be a very tough start too, because Spurs showed how good they are last season.\n“Of course, they were our last Premier League opponents here too, which was a memorable match for everyone. But this time around it will be completely different.\n“After Spurs, then we have a good run of games, and I’m pleased to see it’s quite a balanced list in terms of the teams we’re up against.”\nThe Magpies have announced a third pre-season friendly, against Hearts at Tynecastle on Friday, July 14 (7.45pm).\nThey have already set up trips to Preston (July 22) and Bradford City (July 26).\nHearts are managed by former Newcastle coach Ian Cathro, who left St James’s Park last season to take charge at the Scottish Premiership club, while ex-Magpie defender Aaron Hughes is in their squad.\nOnly three stands at Tynecastle will be open because of ongoing redevelopment.\nNewcastle have met Hearts 27 times going back to 1897, but the most recent meeting was back in August, 1995, when a Peter Beardsley goal secured a 1-0 win for the Tynesiders in front of a 13,337 crowd.\nOther visits in recent memory include a 1-0 defeat, to a goal from Ian Baird, in 1992, a 1-0 victory in 1987 when Paul Gascoigne scored and a 1-1 draw in 1980, when Bobby Shinton’s Magpie opener was cancelled out by a goal from Chris Robertson, brother of future Newcastle forward John Robertson.\nThe clubs also met over two legs in the Texaco Cup in September, 1971. An Andy Lynch strike gave Hearts victory in the first leg in Edinburgh, but Newcastle won the return 2-1 thanks to a double from Malcolm Macdonald, with defender Alan Anderson’s goal late in extra time setting up a shoot-out decider.\nNewcastle edged through 4-3.", "url": "http://www.sunderlandecho.com/sport/football/newcastle-united/spaniards-wait-on-next-move-from-newcastle-on-defender-1-8596196"}

{"text": "Italian election campaign thrives on trash talk\n\nROME (AP) — In Italy's general election campaign, Rome's uncollected garbage has become fodder for politicians — and at least one pig.\nThe capital's dirty streets, lined with brimming-over, nasty-smelling garbage bins, are providing a handy way to trash the performance of Mayor Virginia Raggi, arguably the most high-profile office-holder of the 5-Star Movement. The populist party is leading in opinion polls and chasing its first premiership in the March 4 vote.\nThe fact that Raggi isn't running in that race hasn't stopped leaders of rival parties from recycling the city's chronic trash problem into a campaign trail issue. So when a pig was seen rooting through a pile of garbage bags along a Rome street earlier this month, rivals gleefully grabbed the opportunity.\nEx-premier Matteo Renzi, whose own Democratic Party has taken quite a drubbing in recent opinion polls, evoked the she-wolf, associated with the legend of ancient Rome's founding. He quipped that \"before, there was the wolf, now there's the pig as Rome's symbol to the world.\"\nRight-wing leader Giorgia Meloni, a partner in a conservative electoral alliance with former Premier Silvio Berlusconi posted a photo of the pig on Facebook, its snout poking through mounds of garbage. Her comment: \"This is what Rome is.\"\nMiffed, the mayor told reporters at City Hall that municipal police officers had determined that the animal had wandered off from its owner.\nRaggi smelled campaigning behind the trash polemics.\n\"Politics should be about something else,\" Raggi told reporters at a news conference called to unveil the city's pilot recycling program.\nIn the days following the pig incident, however, some residents in Rome noted a flurry of cleanup efforts, including street-cleaning trucks and new containers to replace decrepit, stinky recycling bins.\nIn Raggi's defense, Rome seems to be eternally lurching from one garbage emergency to the next, irrespective of who is in charge. Trash pileups have plagued at least two previous administrations, one left-leaning and the other right-wing.\nCitizens have staunchly opposed new dumps or waste-treatment facilities in their neighborhoods. Making matters worse, municipal trash collection agency AMA has been dogged by scandals and hampered by scarce funds to purchase new, modern equipment.\nBut this latest crisis is particularly bad timing for the 5-Stars. When the election date was announced in late December, trash collectors were overwhelmed by tons of waste from holiday merrymaking. Some streets saw no garbage trucks for days.\nItaly's Emilia Romagna region, led by a Democratic Party governor, offered to take tons of garbage off Rome's hands for several weeks following Christmas. 5-Star politicians declared that Rome didn't need such a rescue, and, citing high costs of transporting the garbage far away, the city nixed the offer.\nLast fall, Rome also launched a pilot program to encourage more recycling in the Old Ghetto neighborhood, where ancient narrow alleys and claustrophobically close apartment buildings make garbage collection a particular challenge.\nAMA president Lorenzo Bagnacani claimed satisfied locals told city officials: \"This looks like Switzerland.\"\nAs well as the trash issue, Raggi is under investigation in a probe stemming from the appointment of an official in her administration. And she isn't the only 5-Star mayor with problems.\nIn the northwestern city of Turin, Chiara Appendino, who trounced a Democratic Party incumbent to become mayor in 2016, won rave reviews in her first months. But her star, too, has dulled.\nAuditors recently refused to handle Turin's books because of the sorry state of the city's finances, Italian news reports said. Separately, Appendino and other officials were put under investigation in a probe of a panic-triggered stampede of soccer fans in a Turin square.\nWhat's hard to predict is whether the mayors' stumbling will hurt 5-Star candidates for Parliament on March 4.\n\"The vote for the 5-Star Movement is really a protest vote against the left and the right,\" political analyst Franco Pavoncello told the AP in an interview. Pavoncello, who is president of John Cabot University in Rome, was skeptical poor mayoral performances would make a difference nationally.\n\"People don't vote for the 5-Star Movement because they really expect tremendous performance in running cities, but rather because they are rejecting the previous system,\" he said.\n___\nFrances D'Emilio is on twitter at www.twitter.com/fdemilio", "url": "https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3353844"}
{"text": "Judge blocked California law on life-ending drugs. Now what?\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) — A judge has thrown out a 2016 California law allowing terminally ill people to end their lives after finding that the Legislature unconstitutionally approved it during a special session.\nState Attorney General Xavier Becerra asked an appeals court to block and reverse last week's decision by Riverside County Superior Court Judge Daniel Ottolia.\nThe court denied the request to immediately block the ruling. But experts say Becerra has other legal options and could ask the state Supreme Court to weigh in to try to restore the law.\nFor now, there are many questions on the impact of the ruling. Here are some of them:\nWHAT DID THE LAW ALLOW?\nAdults could obtain a prescription for life-ending drugs if a doctor determined they had six months or less to live. To ensure they didn't have a change of heart, patients had to make two verbal requests at least 15 days apart and submit a written request.\nCalifornia health officials reported 111 terminally ill people took drugs to end their lives in the first six months the law was in effect.\nCompassion & Choices, a national organization that supports the law and wants it reinstated, estimated that 504 Californians requested prescriptions in the law's first year.\nThe next state report on the number of people who took the drugs is expected in July.\nWHAT DID THE JUDGE DECIDE?\nOttolia didn't address the legal issue of whether it was proper to allow people to end their own lives. Rather, he found the law should not have been passed during a special session in 2015.\nThose who supported the measure say state lawmakers were justified in taking up the issue because the session was devoted to health-related topics.\nThe appeals court that refused to block Ottolia's order has not yet considered the state's request to reverse the ruling. Ottolia on Wednesday rejected a request by Compassion & Choices to vacate his decision and scheduled a June 29 hearing on a similar request from the attorney general's office.\nWhat does all this mean for now?\n\"We are in the world that we were before the law went into effect,\" said Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the law school at the University of California, Berkeley.\nWHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE WHO PLANNED TO USE THE LAW?\nPatients who have not obtained prescriptions for life-ending medications can't legally get them now, said Dr. Lonny Shavelson, whose practice was solely focused on those cases.\nShavelson said he still is meeting with patients and taking their initial requests for drugs but not issuing prescriptions. And he said he can't guarantee their requests will count toward the required waiting period should the law be restored.\nShavelson said patients who previously obtained prescriptions can take their medication if they choose to. But with the law not in effect, it's possible a medical examiner could declare the death a suicide, which could create challenges for family members claiming insurance payments.\n\"I am spending a lot of time calming down really freaked-out patients,\" he said.\nCOULD DOCTORS FACE PROSECUTION?\nShavelson said he and his colleagues met recently and determined they were no longer in business because of the judge's ruling. Similarly, Kaiser Permanente halted the health network's end-of-life program.\nWhat would happen to a doctor who wrote a prescription? Experts said that's largely up to prosecutors and can vary by jurisdiction.\nMatt Valliere, executive director of the Patients' Rights Action Fund that wants the law thrown out, said he believes doctors who write prescriptions can and should be prosecuted for assisting in a suicide, which is a felony under California law.\nKathryn Tucker, executive director of the End of Life Liberty Project, said she doubts prosecutors would go after doctors who continue to treat pre-existing patients. But she said she doesn't expect doctors to issue new prescriptions without greater legal certainty.\nCAN LAWMAKERS PASS ANOTHER LAW?\nIt's possible for lawmakers to propose another measure, but it took years for the state's now-blocked law to be passed. A new proposal on such an emotional issue would not sail through the Legislature.\nTucker said legal wrangling in the courts will likely take less time than another legislative push.\n\"What's at stake is of a very time-sensitive nature,\" she said.\nBecerra's office asked the appeals court to consider the case on a quicker timeframe than the average appeal.", "url": "https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3444492"}

{"text": "Hochbegabtenförderung – Katholischer Kindergarten Sankt Bartholomäus, Bretten-Büchig\nZwei Prozent aller Kinder sind hochbegabt. Sie haben einen IQ von 130 oder mehr und liegen damit kognitiv weit über dem Durchschnitt.\nWeitere acht Prozent gelten mit einem IQ ab 120 als besonders begabt. Sicherheit, ob eine besondere Begabung oder Hochbegabung vorliegt, kann nur eine professionelle Intelligenzdiagnostik durch eine Psychologin oder einen Psychologen geben. Erste Merkmale können jedoch auch Eltern und Pädagogen beobachten:\nAuffallend rasches und korrektes logisches Schlussfolgern\nHerausragende Gedächtnisfähigkeiten\nDamit einher gehen oft Besonderheiten im Verhalten, wie beispielsweise\nAusgeprägte Tendenz zum Perfektionismus\nGroße Freude am Diskutieren\nSchwieriger Zugang zu Gleichaltrigen\nWichtig ist aber: Hochbegabte Kinder sind so individuell wie alle anderen Kinder auch. Ob eine Hochbegabung oder höhere Begabung, möglicherweise auch nur in Teilbereichen der Intelligenz, vorliegt, kann nur durch eine psychologische Intelligenzdiagnostik sicher geklärt werden.\nAnders als oft angenommen, erkennen die „Kleinen Füchse“ ihre Stärken nicht von selbst. Häufig ist sogar das Gegenteil der Fall: Begabte und hochbegabte Kinder schotten sich ab und werden verhaltensauffällig. Nicht selten sind Fehldiagnosen wie ADHS die Folge.\nDem wirkt die Stiftung Kleine Füchse entgegen. Wir sorgen dafür, dass der besondere Förderbedarf begabter und hochbegabter Jungen und Mädchen erkannt wird und stehen Eltern und pädagogischem Fachpersonal als kompetenter Ansprechpartner rund um das Thema Hochbegabung zur Verfügung.\nDie Idee der Hector Kinderakademien wurde im Jahr 2010 ins Leben gerufen, um begabte Kinder bereits im Grundschulalter zu fördern. Unter der Trägerschaft des Kultusministeriums in Baden-Württemberg werden heute in 66 Kinderakademien in Baden-Württemberg Kinder über ein freiwilliges, zusätzliches Angebot gefördert.\nDies geschieht durch einen Einstieg in neue und die Vertiefung bereits vorhandener Wissensgebiete sowie durch die Entdeckung und den Ausbau persönlicher Begabungsschwerpunkte. Darüber hinaus sollen die Schüler zu selbstständigem und entdeckendem Arbeiten angeregt und ihre Sozialkompetenz gefördert werden. Die Hector Kinderakademien wollen soziale und intellektuelle Herausforderungen schaffen, begabte Kinder und Jugendliche miteinander in Kontakt bringen und deren Interessen und Kenntnisse erweitern.\nLandesverband Hochbegabung\n„Jeder junge Mensch hat ohne Rücksicht auf Herkunft oder wirtschaftliche Lage das Recht auf eine seiner Begabung entsprechende Erziehung und Ausbildung”\nArtikel 11 der Verfassung des Landes Baden-Württemberg …\nFörderung von begabten Kindern und Jugendlichen Baden-Württemberg\nHäufig verstehen wir unter Hochbegabung einen besonders hohen Intelligenzquotienten, der sich in speziellen Tests messen lässt. Aber es gibt verschieden Formen von Begabungen – z. B. in musisch-künstlerischen oder sozialen Bereichen ebenso wie in den kognitiven Bereichen, z. B. in der Mathematik.", "url": "http://xn--kita-st-bartholomus-wwb.de/servicelinks/hochbegabtenfoerderung/"}

{"text": "On this day, the first anniversary of Trump’s presidency, the same day our government has been shut down, women are marching all around our country- AGAIN. Women are claiming their power to define, establish and maintain their human rights as citizens of the United States and of the world.\nThis is nothing new. For centuries (possibly millennia!) women have had to defend their very femininity against concurrent cultural perceptions of their intellect and abilities, as well as their worth and status in society. It has become tedious to address each cultural nuance, each new attack against womanhood, which presents itself. Given that it is our female anatomy and physiology which allow for the continued procreation of humankind, what in hell is the problem? Remember, “it takes TWO, baby!” to make a baby. Women and men are equal partners. Why have our cultures throughout the ages failed to reflect this equality? The likely answer is: PREGNANCY.\nDuring pregnancy, women are somewhat physically and emotionally vulnerable. While this vulnerability is temporary, it can be misperceived as weakness- and therefore exploited. Further, until the recent era of ready access to dependable methods of birth control, it was common for women to get pregnant every two to three years. They spent years of their lives in a vulnerable state.\nThroughout history, we have attempted to control our fertility. Anthropologists have discovered condoms made from a variety of materials dating back as far as 3000 years ago. Yet the use of artificial contraception (any method other than abstinence) has created enormous cultural and religious controversy for centuries. Changing the number of pregnancies women experience would of course create change in society. Those changes are not totally predictable, nor are they necessarily desirable to all.\n1960- Enovid, the first birth control pill, cleared the FDA for human use.\n1965- The US Supreme Court gave married couples the right to use birth control, but unmarried women in 26 states were denied access to birth control pills.\n1972- In Baird v. Eisenstadt the US Supreme Court legalized birth control methods for all citizens regardless of marital status.\n2018- We’re still marching. Sexual harassment against women reached a tipping point last year, and our hidden shame has been thrown off by giving it our voice. Epidemic domestic violence continues despite all our efforts.\nIt seems we must keep on marching.\nDedicated to my four granddaughters: Allyson, Christina, Amber, and Elizabeth; and to my two grandsons, Joseph and Jacob.\n. . . . ENTER: the intruder . . . .\nOur lives devoid of sanity, of hope . . .\nBy profession, I am a registered nurse practitioner specializing in anesthesia. In 1990, I also completed a BA in Cultural Anthropology. While pursuing my studies, I’d been enthralled by Margaret Mead’s research in American Samoa for her doctoral thesis in Anthropology. I’d also had the opportunity to meet her daughter, Mary Catherine Bateson, when she was a visiting lecturer at George Mason University. So when an advertisement appeared in our anesthesia journal in early 1992 seeking volunteers to work in American Samoa, I knew I had to respond! I wanted to experience Mead’s South Pacific paradise for myself!\nMaking it happen was no small task. I didn’t want to move out of my condo, so my son Michael agreed he would stay there and cover the expenses. I contacted LBJ Tropical Medical Center and told them of my interest, sending my resume and copies of licenses, etc. I also began looking into possible free-lance work to do after I returned. I told my boss about my plans, and to my surprise, he offered me a leave of absence instead. I happily accepted. Finally I was ready to go!\nDr. Sam met me at the airport on July 1, 1992. He told me I would be staying at the Rainmaker Hotel temporarily because a hurricane the previous year had damaged the volunteer apartments. The hotel was lovely; I settled in and began working the next day at the hospital, which was about a mile away. But by July 7th, I wrote in my diary, “I’m bored staying here!” So I visited the damaged area to assess the condition of my future “home.” The apartments were filthy but some were structurally intact. I chose one with a roof (!!!) and then went to speak to the head doctor of the hospital. I suggested I could clean up the place myself. He agreed, so the next day I moved my belongings and went to work!\nFor the next few days, I provided anesthesia services during the day under less than optimal conditions. Medications were in short supply, equipment was outdated and un-serviced. I had to be constantly alert for the types of problems I’d never encounter on the US continent. Evenings at “home” were just as challenging! The apartment was not air-conditioned and depended upon louvered windows (with no curtains) for air circulation. I had also quickly discovered my four- and eight-legged roomies! Roaches, rats and geckos had preceded me! I cleaned to discourage the roaches, repaired the cupboard bottoms which allowed constant access for the rats, and decided the geckos were my friends! So when I went to bed on July 11, 1992, I was exhausted!\nGroggy confusion quickly gave way to pure terror. I screamed at him to get out, irrationally demanding to know who he was and what he wanted. As he slowly walked toward me, I sat up and wrapped myself in my bed sheet and grabbed my glasses. Then he plopped into the chair near my bed and said, “I just want to talk.” Right! Although it was quite dark in the room, I could see he was wearing only swim trunks. I demanded to know how he’d gotten in and he told me he’d broken in with his knife; then he reached for my cigarettes on the table and knocked over a glass of water at my bedside. It shattered on the floor. ….. Shorts. Knife. Broken glass….. No idiot would believe his intentions were to merely “talk” to me. My heart sank; I put my hand to my forehead wondering how I was going to get out of this alive. He asked, “what’s the matter?” “I’m tired,” I lied.\n“I’ve gotta pee. Where’s your bathroom?” he asked.\n“Right across from the door you broke into!” I barked.\nThe time had come. I waited until he got through the bedroom doorway then said I needed to get some water. Carefully, I got out of bed at the foot, avoiding the shattered glass. He didn’t turn. I hurried toward my kitchen, opened the outside door and ran! The slamming door alerted him, but he couldn’t have had time to pee- he chased me! Thankfully I had enough of a head start toward (hopefully) inhabited apartments. He saw where I was going, then turned and ran the other way.\nThe person who responded to my door banging called hospital security, who chased down the intruder and called the police. They brought him in handcuffs so I could ID him. But he looked me in the face and said, “It was me.” I asked him why, and he said he’d seen me through the windows and I’d looked “nice.” He was taken to jail briefly then sentenced to be publicly shunned. Several days later, the Assistant Attorney General of American Samoa called to tell me about how shunning is used to shame people for certain crimes when no physical injury had taken place. He said it works very well in their culture, as public avoidance causes much shame. He also asked me to please stay for my promised three months, as Samoans depended on their volunteers for health care. I assured him I had no intention of leaving.\nLocal people and my friends and family were very concerned and supportive. The emotional toll wasn’t a burden I could have easily carried without their help. Yet there were just a few who asked, “What’s the big deal? He didn’t hurt you, so. . . ?” But of course pain is rarely only physical. The comments and attitudes of those few still haunt me, just as the sight of the intruder’s knife left behind near my chair haunts me. They are just a tiny glimpse of what the “Silence Breakers” must face.\nDonald Trump should be removed from office immediately.\nThis missive is not meant to convince you of Mr. Trump’s incompetency in his role as President of the United States. Your own eyes and ears have informed you of his instability, narcissism, paranoia and lack of a normal moral compass. You have no doubt felt waves of disbelief, disgust, and fear in your heart and gut as you witnessed his behavior, listened to his words, and read his “tweets.” Your internal body wisdom has been flashing a neon warning sign! Yet you have a job to do, a career to pursue. And so you have attempted to accommodate him and “give him a chance,” because after all, some of his beliefs mirror your own. And of course what can you accomplish for your constituents if you are not re-elected? But being co-opted into Mr. Trump’s mindset and allowing him to set normalcy standards of behavior and belief are not conducive to fulfilling your duties as our representatives. Neither will it be possible to try to work around him. He is a dangerous and unpredictable man. [Please read The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump, October 2017, ed. Bandy Lee, MD. Contributors are 27 mental health experts who felt it was their civic and moral “duty to warn” us of the danger Mr. Trump presents to the USA in his presidential role.] Therefore it is incumbent upon each of you to ask yourself some difficult questions: Who am I? What do I believe? What are my most cherished goals? Each must be answered honestly (if only to yourself!) without prejudice or rationalization. Then remind yourself there is strength in numbers!\nWe, the people of the United States, have elected a group of wise, moral and powerful women and men to help us maintain and improve upon the nation our forefathers created for us. To do so, you must reclaim your power and become a united front! Together, your primary responsibility must be to help heal the divisiveness in our country. All other agendas must wait. A gentle, non-judgmental hand will be needed to accomplish so noble a goal. Keep in mind Mr. Trump won the presidency by acknowledging and validating the concerns and fears of some among us. That in itself is commendable for all who aspire to leadership, as the knowledge may be used to realistically address common concerns. But such was not Mr. Trump’s goal. He inflamed fear and anger while emboldening incivility toward one another. He encouraged scapegoating- blaming the “OTHER” for our problems. Then he decreed only he could help. Mr. Trump appeared to be understanding, empathetic. But his goal was to create an image that would buy him a win, the power of the presidency. The image is a sham.\nBy reclaiming your power and leadership, you who represent us in Congress can stand united and reject the “malignant normality” presented by Mr. Trump. [Terminology used by Robert Lifton, MD, in the aforementioned book. It refers to creating a culture in which abhorrent practices are deemed “normal.”] Using either impeachment proceedings or the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, you can reveal the sham Mr. Trump has engendered. By being truthful and sincerely empathetic yourself and by avoiding making Mr. Trump himself a scapegoat, you can remove him from office and prevent further damage to your integrity and the integrity of our country. Then through legislation and public discussions, you can encourage us to reaffirm that all human beings deserve dignity, respect and kindness. You have the power to empower, to remind us we are each in control of our own destiny; blame and shame have no useful place in our lives.\nI beseech each of you to do your part as an elected and trusted leader of our country. Thank you for choosing to serve us.\nWith just one chance to care.\nOur minds charge, “Be aware!\nWe must answer . . . . .\n. . . . . with a prayer.\nThe need to love and be loved: our primal cry is just that simple and just that complex. Love demands much from us. Caring, compassion, kindness and commitment rank high among those requirements. Without love none of us would survive beyond birth. We need each other. Alone, we die. Together we flourish and have the opportunity to experience joy, hope purpose and contentment in our lives. Yet nothing is guaranteed. That means we have work to do!\nFully understanding who we are as human beings is our essential task. When I refer to us as “wholly holy humans,” I mean we are the embodiment of conscience and love [holy] with the instinct for personal and species survival [human.] These two primary aspects of human nature are permanently intricately intertwined. Nevertheless, tension exists between them. This tension may be thought of as a tug-of-war for dominance. Our holiness and our humanness are constantly competing for our attention as we choose how to view both the world and our place in it. This tension gives birth to most of the challenges we face throughout life.\nOur personal and species survival rely upon our interdependence with each other, which in turn requires us to love and have compassion for one another. Meanwhile, our humanness decrees we want to define the terms for interdependence! Moreover, our definition of survival has become, “I want to be who I choose, live as I choose, while maintaining my self-esteem along with my reputation and status in society!” Each and every time we perceive our desires are threatened or under attack, we feel afraid.\nFear may lead to anger, antagonism, even war. But on a day-to-day basis, fear often lurks beneath our awareness, creating suspicion, hypervigilance, and anxiety. Such states of mind may lead us to misinterpret the people and circumstances in our lives. Too often, we don’t recognize our fear and ‘own’ it as an essential and useful part of who we are. Instead, because we have come to believe fear is a human weakness, we externalize it. Consequently we mislabel our fear (often in a self-serving or righteous manner!) then name a scapegoat.\nOur scapegoats take many forms: another person; a group of people; natural and accidental events; a world view or a religion; a supernatural being like a devil. All become diversions which prevent us from correctly understanding our own issues and finding useful solutions to them. They waste our time, emotions and energy while leading us down a rabbit hole. We may war with our scapegoats, but we can never control them!\nFortunately there is another path. By recognizing and embracing who we are as human beings, we can actually nurture our holiness by putting our survival instinct to good use, the use for which it was intended! It is incumbent upon all of us to use our innate intelligence to continuously question our perceptions with self-honesty and an open mind. Our challenges were born within us. Their solutions must come from within. Voila! Control is in reach!\nThe people of Charlottesville, Virginia, who endured bearing witness to the consequences of fear run amuck while seeing events for what they really were, yet persevering with grace, dignity and forgiveness.\nThe people in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and all the Caribbean Islands who were in the path of recent hurricanes, along with those who came to provide assistance. The world was privileged to witness your struggle as you faced catastrophic conditions. You showed all of us the enormous capabilities of humanity, giving us hope. May your recovery be swift, your hearts lightened.\nWe must take care of ourselves before we can take care of others.\nTogether these truisms exemplify one approach toward living our best life possible. They tell us we must each nurture our own physical and mental health before we are capable of caring for another. Then we must meet our responsibilities to those closest to us- our families and communities- to the best of our ability. Furthermore, we should do so while recognizing and relying upon our interdependence with one another. Many of us prioritize our personal lives in this way, and we often apply the same truisms to any large body of people with whom we form an allegiance as well. For example, we may put the needs of our own country above the needs of other nations.\nA. PLANET HEALTH: Gone are the days when we, as a much smaller number of human beings, could avail ourselves of the earth’s resources without much concern. Now, given the enormous growth in our population, we cannot deny our presence here affects the health of our planet, its ecosystem and atmosphere. It is essential for each of us to respect and nurture our environment. We are responsible for taking care of the only home we are likely to inhabit.\nTry to imagine living in a world without our co-operation to maintain human rights. I doubt many of us would care to live in such a world. Our humanity must be cherished by all, for all. We can only hope to enjoy human rights if we are willing to protect them for everyone.\nWe have heard a great deal lately about putting “America First.” Our allegiance and commitment to our great country is honorable and commendable. Yet our first priority must always be to humanity and its survival. Our allegiances should and can be balanced within the larger reality. Our innate goodness and humanitarianism- the holiness in our humanity- will guide us.\nI published this originally with the intention of addressing why the average person lies, how our lies affect us, and what we can do to change our behavior. This essay does NOT address those who are chronic liars or who have personality disorders. Those people are not likely to be amenable to either advice or treatment.\nUntil the lie was whispered.\nUntil the lie was confirmed.\nUntil the lie was repeated.\nUntil the lie was denied.\nWe tell ourselves stories: stories which include part reality, part perception, and lies- tiny lies, huge lies, self-serving lies. Sometimes we even lie to ourselves about why we tellthose lies. So can it be any surprise we lie to others? Why are we so dishonest?", "url": "https://whollyholyhuman.com/category/uncategorized/page/2/"}

{"text": "The solar panel is also called the photovoltaic panel; it is a device that works by converting the sunlight directly into the electrical energy. Solar panels are made on many solar cells and are interconnected with both series as well as the shunt configuration. Sun is a powerful planet and it has the ability to provide energy for the entire human living only if it is used in the right manner. For the past two decades, solar power has been used as an alternative to a source of energy and has played a beneficial role in development.\nThe photoelectric effect theory of Einstein can be used to understand the operation of solar cells. First let’s try to understand the physical structure, a semiconductor device that has two or more than two doped layers for forming the junctions. These junctions show a response towards different wavelengths of sunlight and any other form of light that has small packets of energy called the photons. The sun has the ability to produce about 1000 watts per square meter.\nThe solar cell produces a voltage that is very small and is not of any practical use, in order to overcome these many different solar cells are joined together to form a practical amount of energy. Each solar cell has the capacity to produce about 0.2A at 1.2V producing the output of 0.24W of power. A solar panel is formed with the connection of solar cells, and these solar panels on connection forms modules.\nIn order to make homes and businesses in the UK more productive a Green deal has been finalized which helps in making improvement in productivity. It allows the person to get qualified to achieve free solar panels grants and the loans for solar energy in the UK.\nThe green deal is a government program which works with the property owners and the private businesses to promote the ways to save energy and to get the efficiently produce energy. The home that wishes to get this deal, is being first analyzed and typical improvements are discussed and then the program helps the owner of the house to get them to achieve different ways to finance this improvement.\nThere are many ways through which energy can be saved and in turn money and power will be saved.\nKent solar power has Solar panels networks which include the network of many different companies that are working to deliver the best quality of the solar system and also to provide the cost-effective installation of the solar system in Kent. The solar panel network was made to provide a system that saves money and time for its customer. This network has the most experienced, certified installers that work best to provide the best installation to its suppliers. The solar panel network covers the whole UK for residential as well as for commercial customers.", "url": "https://www.whomever.co.uk/2018/08/04/solar-panel-installer-in-kent/"}

{"text": "Three Quick Approaches To Regrowing Your Pasture Grass For Happier Cows - what makes a farm successful?\nGrass-fed cows produce healthier milk and beef products than cows that are fed treated grain or hay and alfalfa with added vitamin boosters, which could be laced with pesticides. If you are just starting a grass-fed beef and dairy farm, you will find out very quickly that keeping up with the grass demands for your herd goes beyond nature's ability to keep up. Here are three quick approaches to regrowing pasture grass for happier, healthier cows.\nIf you grew crops to feed your herd, you would rotate your crops to keep the land healthy and productive. It is the same with growing enough grass in your pastures to keep up with the appetites of your cows. Keep several large grass pastures and rotate your cows through these pastures once a week to once every other week. This will give the grass in your other pastures time to grow and grow enough grass to feed your herd when you rotate them into the next pasture.\nEven with rotating pasture lands, there will be times of the year when grass feedings are impossible. For those times, you can request sod delivery. Sod usually needs to be implanted over a field to continue growing, but you are using the sod to feed your herd during the colder months when they will be in the barn most of the time and will need sustenance. You may eve stock up on a sod delivery in advance to the coming colder months, stocking and stacking your sod in the barn where other farmers stock and stack hay.\nYou can also use sod to revamp a tired pasture that the herd has just demolished. Sod delivery services may install the sod in your pasture for a fee, or you can choose sod pick up with your own truck and roll out the sod or lay the cut slabs of sod on your own. Just be sure to give the fresh sod a week or two to grow down into the pasture mud before letting your herd graze on it. Click here for info about sod delivery near you.\nThere are some types of grass that grow much faster than others. By spreading a lot of these types of grass seeds around, you can get faster growing grass that can keep your cows well-fed and content for months. Kentucky Blue Grass, ryegrass and centipede grass are all examples of fast-growing grasses that you can purchase seed for and plant to feed your herd.", "url": "http://beta-aa.com/2015/10/28/three-quick-approaches-to-regrowing-your-pasture-grass-for-happier-cows/"}

Then when creating your controller, you just specify what ViewLocator to use, so the controller knows how to find the view.  I can post some code if needed.</p>\n\n<p>This method kind of goes along with some advice I gave another person for separating their views out for a portal using ASP.NET MVC.

{"text": "Discussion in 'Food & Cooking' started by welshstar, Feb 13, 2011.\nI need to improve my diet and have the following observations to date, i love smoothies and juices and want to incorporate them more into my diet.\n1 - I have a traditional $75 ish blender, it works OK but for smoothies etc it just seems to crush the ice and it can only work with soft fruits. It is OK but very limited.\n3 - I bought a top of the range Breville juicer, it was $400, im not sure if it was just me but thing was useless, you have to feed mountains of stuff into it to ge a decent amount of juice out. The juice was great but the cost of produce and the amount of clean up time made this thing impractical, you have to dismantle it and place like 6 peices into the dishwasher everytime you juiced. I returned this unit to the store.\nI saw a Vitamix demo at Wholefoods and was intrigued, from what it appears this unit basically just takes anything you put into it and blasts it into fine peices. I understand the concept of juicers versus blenders but if the Vitamix nukes say apples this way dont you effectively end up with apple juice ? except with more of the fibre intact ?\nFor anyone who is interested I bought the Vitamix and the thing is awesome. Comparing this to a blender is a bit like a guy in a tiger moth dogfighting a guy in a F16, its just not the same beast.", "url": "https://cheftalk.com/threads/food-processor-v-beville-juicer-v-blender-v-vitamix.64209/"}

I’ve tried plugging in the drive, then holding down alt as I start the Mac, but it doesn’t show up in the list of bootable drives.

Earlier versions of Intel Macs don't support booting from USB drives as far as I know.</p>\n\n<p>The only other possibility would be your partition structure.  Intel Macs use the EFI boot loader, and these prefer the GPT partition structure rather than MBR.  If you look closely enough at a drive formatted by Boot Camp Assistant, you'll see a very small FAT32 partition at the beginning of the drive.  This is so the partition can be \"blessed\" and marked as the preferred bootable volume on the machine, so if you restart it automatically boots to that OS.  If you cloned the disk from one that you used in a PC, it's most likely formatted MBR.</p>\n\n<p>However, I have verified that it is possible to boot to MBR Windows volumes by holding down the Option key.  Only thing is the Windows volumes don't show up until later.  However, I'm not sure if this works at all via USB.  I would think not.</p>\n\n<p>First step in troubleshooting would be to check and see if your Mac Mini can boot to a USB volume at all... i.e. use Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper to clone your Mac volume to a USB drive and see if you can boot from it.</p>\n", "url": null}

{"text": "Bund futures are complicated by their contract design which stipulates physical delivery by the Short for each futures contract of €100,000 face value from a choice of deliverable bonds. Conversion factors exist to compensate for a bond being delivered with a coupon other than the 6% also specified in the contract design. This process involves the Long paying the Bund EDSP x the conversion factor + Accrued Interest on the delivery date on the bond being delivered and gives rise to cheapest-to-deliver optionality, when the yield curve is anything but 6%.\nThe theoretical value of the Bund future should be the forward value on the delivery date of the cheapest to deliver in the basket of deliverable bonds, divided by the conversion factor.\nUnfortunately, that’s not the end of the story, rather the start. If you were to price a bund future using the above formula you would find it was higher than the actual market price of the future. This is the net basis (when multiplied by the conversion factor) and reflects all that embedded optionality mentioned above. The optionality exists because the cheapest to deliver bond underlying the bond future can change plus there are additional sources of optionality; namely switch and wildcard optionality, which are specific to the actual delivery process.\nAll the above are known knowns and have been for over two decades. Consequently, that means that the embedded optionality in bund futures is pretty fairly quantified by the market, leaving things like bund rolls being driven by more mundane things like supply and demand and financing considerations. Bund rolls are the effect on the calendar spread of the rolling process of open positions in the front month into the back month to maintain directional bias.\nThe chart shows the effects of the Z3H4 roll. The blue and red shading is open interest for Z3 and H4 respectively (left axis) and the Z3 and H4 prices are prices on the right axis.\nIt can be seen that the open interest in Z3 coincides with a rally in Z3 bund prices and so it could be inferred the trend following traders, (systematic hedge funds like MAN, Winton and Bluetrend plus CTA’s) are long and might want to maintain the positions into H4. This means at some stage they will have to sell their Z3 holdings and buy H4 futures. This would cause a spread cheapening or narrowing. The window for trading the roll is quite narrow since it can be seen that the H4 doesn’t come to life in trading volume or OI until early November 2013, and doesn’t really pick up until end of November. This means that there is only about two weeks in which to actively trade the roll but the trader could have actively positioned expecting a roll of long interest by selling the Z3H4 spread.\nThe following chart shows that the Z3H4 spread could have been sold in early November for around zero and subsequently fell about 15 ticks by early December. Only in the last days did the spread widen dramatically.\nBund rolls are amazingly complex driven by a multiple of factors.\nRelative value of each futures contract to the basket of underlying deliverable bonds.\nDirectional bias of open interest.\nOften it is changes in repo rates that can cause volatility in the final days approaching the last trading day of 6th December. Bunds that are cheapest to deliver can often trade special, sometimes at negative repo rates which can make the futures contracts drop. That might have happened here to the H4 relative to the Z3.\nThis entry was tagged bond future rolls, bund rolls, calendar spreads, cheapest to deliver, net basis.

To answer your question, the pulmicort turbo haler is a steroid inhaler that will reduce the inflammation in your lungs. It will not give you instant relief. You need to use it as prescribed. This is a really good drug, but it takes about a week to 10 days to start having an effect and up to 3 weeks to reach its full effectiveness.\nAsthavent, is albuterol, a quick acting reliever to reduce immediate symptoms.\nAs someone who is newly diagnosed it may take a while for your doctor to get your drugs at the right level. If you are still very symptomatic after taking these medications for a couple of weeks you need to go back to your doctor. There are lots and lots of different Asthma medications and some work better for some people than others.\nIf you are not taking an antihistamine, perhaps that would help.

Look it up on the internet. Salt inhaler, salt lights.\nI have a salt inhaler & am convinced it's helped me.\nHi Martin, thanks for replying to me, I do have a himalaya lamp which helps but now the summer is coming I feel so ill with the pollen and pollution I have a very bad reaction to mosquitoes and now I have sand bites from my hike yesterday.. just so fed up.. it's only since I moved to Cape Town I suffer with asthma etc.\nPollen & pollution are a problem for many in a lot of places. Defo try the Himalayan salt inhaler. It claims to help with allergy problems. I have a duoresp spiromax inhaler that I just use once in the morning & once in the evening.

{"text": "businessstammtisch Dornbirn_26.11.2019 - Wirtschaftbund Bundesleitung\nDie Bürgermeisterin informierte die vielen interessierten Dornbirner UnternehmerInnen darüber, dass Dornbirn in Bälde 50.000 Hauptwohnsitze zählen wird. Damit ist Dornbirn die 10. größte Stadt Österreichs. In Dornbirn leben 116 Nationen auf 120 km2, wobei lediglich 16 km2 besiedelt sind. Die Stadt Dornbirn beschäftigt 1.904 Mitarbeiter auf 1.450 Dienstposten, wobei der größte Teil auf die Dornbirner Gesundheitsbetriebe entfällt.\nEine hohe Investitionsquote, ein positives freies Budget, keine Nettoneuverschuldung und das Halten der Rücklagen auf hohem Niveau formulierte das Dornbirner Stadtoberhaupt als Ziele für das in Bälde von der Stadtvertretung zu beschließende Budget 2019.\nDie erfolgreiche Wirtschaftspolitik Dornbirns, die in den vergangenen Jahrzehnten Unternehmen am Standort Dornbirn halten oder neu dazugewinnen konnte, stand im Mittelpunkt des Ausblicks, den die Bürgermeisterin den Dornbirner UnternehmerInnen gab. Die Neuerrichtung der Volksschule Haselstauden, die Schaffung neuer Operationssääle im städtischen Krankenhaus, der Neubau der Stadtbibliothek, der Bau des neuen Polizeigebäudes am Dornbirner Bahnhof, der Bau des neuen Campingplatzes in der Enz, der Bau des Entlastungsstollens für den Steinebach durch den Zanzenberg in die Dornbirner Ache, etc., um nur einige wenige zu nennen, werden die Investitionsschwerpunkte 2019 bilden. Die Förderung der Digitalisierung der Stadt im Sinne von Smart City hat ebenfalls eine besondere Bedeutung.\nDie Bürgermeisterin hat über den Stand der Realisierung des Autobahnanschlusses Schweizerstraße, den weiteren Ausbau der beiden Betriebsgebiete Süd, an welchem unter anderem die Firmen Blum, Schlosserei Kalb, Prade Wohnbau, Schluge, etc. angesiedelt sind, und Dornbirn Nord mit den Firmen Heron, Sonderhoff, Z-Werkzeugbau, Bäckerei Mangold, etc, in welchen zusammen rund 600 Personen arbeiten, die weitere Optimierung des Dornbirner Stadtbussystems mit derzeit ca 25.000 Einsteigern pro Tag und über verschiedenste städtebauliche Konzepte wie das Areal „Kleiner Luger“, das „Villenviertel Oberdorf“, das Areal „Altes Kino“ oder die „Tiefgarage Realschulstraße“ berichtet.\nBesondere Projekte der Stadt, wie etwa die Weltgymnaestrada 2019, die Kulturhauptstadt 2024, die Digitale Offensive, die Einrichtung eines Industrielehrpfades, das Projekt „Essbare Stadt“, die Vision „Markthalle“ und viele mehr wurden ebenso vorgestellt.\nNeue Rekorde bei den Nächtigungszahlen zeigen deutlich, dass sich Investitionen in den Tourismus und Freizeitbereich rentieren.", "url": "https://www.wirtschaftsbund.at/genticscms/vorarlberg/veranstaltungen/businessstammtisch_Dornbirn_26.11.2019.html"}

Kuwait, Canada, Israel, Syria and Russia each lost one citizen.\nSixty-nine people were also wounded.

{"text": "At Least 18 Dead After Gunmen Seize A Cafe For Hours In Burkina Faso\n\nGunmen stormed an upscale cafe overnight in Burkina Faso's capital, Ouagadougou, strafing the building with bullets and barricading themselves inside for hours. By the time security forces reclaimed the restaurant around dawn Monday, at least 18 people had been killed and eight others wounded, according to local authorities.\nThe West African nation's communications minister, Remis Dandjinou, told reporters Monday that by daybreak, two of the attackers had been killed and several foreign nationals were among the dead. In separate statements, officials in Paris and Ankara confirmed the victims include a French citizen and Turkish citizen, while another Turk was injured in the violence.\nWhile Burkinabe officials blamed Islamist militants for the attack on the Turkish cafe, no one group immediately claimed responsibility.\n\"I salute the bravery of our security and defense forces whose engagement allowed us to neutralize the terrorists,\" Burkinabe President Roch Marc Christian Kabore said in a statement, as translated by CNN.\n\"The struggle against terrorism is a lengthy fight,\" he added. \"That is why I am calling for vigilance, solidarity and unity of the whole nation to face up to the cowardice of our enemies.\"\nIn a news conference Monday, Dandjinou detailed the night's bloody events, which opened when he says about three to four militants rolled up to the cafe on motorcycles around 9 p.m. local time. They opened fire on an outside seating area outside then moved indoors, where The New York Times notes a family had been celebrating a 9-year-old boy's birthday.\nThe newspaper reports the boy was hospitalized with injuries from the attack.\nFor Burkinabes, the attack on Aziz Istanbul cafe, which is popular with foreigners, prompts bitter memories of another bloody episode just over 18 months ago. In January last year, militants conducted an hours-long raid on a luxury hotel and a cafe just blocks away from Aziz Istanbul, ultimately killing some 30 people before being dislodged by security forces.\nAl-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, a militant group based in the region, claimed responsibility for that attack — as well as another deadly assault just months before in neighboring Mali.\nIslamist groups have been active for years in the Sahel region, which includes Mali and Burkina Faso. As groups linked to al-Qaida have carried out attacks in the area, the Times points out that the United Nations peacekeeping mission to Mali \"has become one of the most dangerous in the world.\"\nThe French government — which controlled Burkina Faso, then called Upper Volta, as a colony until 1960 — says President Emmanuel Macron met with Kabore on Monday to discuss the circumstances of the latest attack.\nThe pair of leaders also reaffirmed their commitment to the formation of an international security force in the Sahel region to \"continue the fight against terrorist groups.\"", "url": "http://tpr.org/post/least-18-dead-after-gunmen-seize-cafe-hours-burkina-faso"}

Civil rights groups believe that racial bias is at play and insist that federal protections are necessary. Other experts say that imposing discipline restrictions on schools causes chaos in classrooms.\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos is considering scrapping Obama-era rules that were meant to counter those disparities.\nData shows that while black students represented 8 percent of all enrolled students in 2015-2016, they accounted for 25 percent of suspensions.

{"text": "Great news, you’ve gotten the call and they like you. Now comes the hard part. Interviews can be one of the most nerve-racking things you’ll experience during your professional life. You need to be professional, quick-witted and friendly as you answer a multitude of questions. Though you can’t predict all of the questions you’ll be asked, a majority of job interviews are set up for you to succeed if you are knowledgeable. That said, there is plenty you can do to be prepared.\nThe interview can be the toughest part of any job search but we’ll help make sure you do your best.\nAn interview can be a lot of different things, especially for an aspiring nurse practitioner or physician assistant. While questions will certainly be part of the process, you should also expect to be tested on your specific skills in real situations. In healthcare, you’re expected to be able to think quickly on your feet, so be sure you’re comfortable with spontaneity.\nWhile that will help determine your ability to work under certain situations, basic questions will be aimed more at learning about you. Your interviewer will want to learn about your past, both professional and educational, and get a better feel for how your experience will determine your future performance. Be sure to highlight your accomplishments, even if they seem small. Employers want to see passion and competence and playing up the highlights of your past work goes a long way towards doing that.\nStudy up on the job listing and know the ins and outs of it. While job listings may share titles, you may be looking at different responsibilities or expectations depending on the office. On that same note, learn a little bit about the practice, as being knowledgeable about the people you hope to work with will help you better explain how you hope to fit in.\nNever assume anything with your interviewer. While a big part of succeeding is simply being yourself, don’t assume you can be entirely casual. If your interviewer takes things a little more lightly, then you’re free to open up as well, but always display professionalism in an interview.\nLastly, don’t be so nervous. It’s easier said than done for some, but don’t look at an interview as a be-all end-all meeting. You can only control your performance, the rest is out of your hands. Relax, smile and be your smart and capable self.\nAt NP PA Recruiters, we strive to make sure that you not only ace the interview, but also get the job.

{"text": "Online-Journalismus: Was ist erlaubt, was nicht! – NEUNsight\nNeben den bekannten Namen der Medien-Branche hat diese Entwicklung aber auch für einen Boom unter den nicht-professionellen Journalisten gesorgt. Blogger und selbständige Schreiber haben dem Online-Journalismus zu seinem Erfolg verholfen. Allerdings gilt es auch in dieser Branche auf einige grundlegende Regeln zu achten.\nWerte verschwimmen\nEs sind vor allem die technischen Möglichkeiten, die es heute so einfach machen, selbst als Journalist aktiv zu werden. Bereits die Installation von einem Blog und eine gewisse Reichweite über die sozialen Medien oder Google reichen aus, damit Leser generiert werden können. Das führt dazu, dass immer mehr Menschen über Themen berichten, die sie entweder bewegen oder das Interesse ihrer Zielgruppe wecken können. Mit der Popularität\ndes Online-Journalismus sind allerdings auch die grundlegenden Werte, die über viele Jahrzehnte den Bereich bestimmt haben, verschwommen. Themen wie Fake-News oder die beständige Vermischung von Werbung und redaktioneller Berichterstattung haben zuletzt die Gemüter bewegt.\nWelche Dinge sind erlaubt und welche ein Problem?\nDer Einstieg in den Online-Journalismus ist einfach. Die wenigsten Schreiber wissen jedoch, wie schnell sie sich in einer problematischen Situation befinden können. Das beginnt schon bei so einfachen Themen wie Fotos oder Textauszügen. Es ist natürlich reizvoll, einen Artikel mit einem Bild aus dem Internet zu garnieren oder sich einfach eines Abschnittes aus einem anderen Text zu bedienen. Spätestens wenn die erste Abmahnung im Briefkasten ist, zeigen sich aber die Gefahren. Das Urheberrecht hat eine ebenso stark steigende Bedeutung im Internet wie es der Online-Journalismus hat. Möchte man also eine Bildquelle haben, sollte man sich der Quellen bedienen, die entweder kostenlos und mit einem entsprechenden Urheberrecht zur Verfügung stehen oder sich eine Lizenz für professionelle Dienste besorgen.\n„Fake News“ und Werbung als Redaktion versteckt\nAuch dem Thema „Fake-News“ sollte Beachtung geschenkt werden. Nur weil die Möglichkeit besteht über alle Dinge zu schreiben, bedeutet das nicht, dass es auch erlaubt ist. Offenkundige Lügen sind ebenso verboten wie die Verpackung von Werbung in redaktionellen Inhalten. Möchte man sich in diesem Bereich einen Namen machen, sollte man auf die Integrität und Qualität der eigenen Inhalte achten und dafür\nsorgen, dass die Quellen nicht nur verlässlich sind, sondern auch die Wahrheit enthalten. Soziale Verantwortung wird zu einem wichtigen Faktor im Online-Journalismus werden und daher auch ein wichtiges Thema für jeden sein, der hier aktiv werden möchte.\nEine umfangreiche Informations- und Dokumentationsquelle ist der Deutsche Journalisten Verband (DJV), der dem Thema „Digitaler Journalismus“ eigene Konferenzen und Symposien widmet, in denen neben Rechtsfragen auch praktische Tipps zu Ausbildung und Karrierechancen gegebene werden.\nGrundsätzlich gelten vergleichbare Regeln für Print- und Online-Journalismus. Auf die Integrität der eigenen Inhalte muss geachtet und dafür Sorge getragen werden, dass die verwendeten Quellen nicht nur verlässlich sind, sondern auch die Wahrheit enthalten. Darüber hinaus wird soziale Verantwortung zu einem wichtigen Faktor im Online-Journalismus, da einmal publizierte Inhalte kaum noch gelöscht werden können.\n← Nicht-Wähler: der stille und unberechenbare Machtfaktor\nGesundheitsbranche: Smarte Produkte gefragt →", "url": "http://neunsight.de/2017/07/03/online-journalismus-was-ist-erlaubt-was-nicht/"}

Und das ist ja keine Dissoziation.\nUnd dann habe ich noch ein bisschen Bauchschmerzen bei dem Begriff \"Gewohnheit\". Das Zähne putzen z.B. habe ich mir angewöhnt bzw. es wurde mir antrainiert.\nEine Dissoziation dagegen kann schon aufgrund eines einzigen traumatischen Ereignissen entstehen. EIne Gewohnheit ist so eine Art Trampelpfad, der über einen längeren Zeitraum entstanden ist und den man jetzt eben immer entlang geht. Eine Dissoziation ist wie eine falsch gestellte Weiche im Schienenverkehr.\n27.07.2012, 13:42 #814\n\"..und Yohimibin, das dafür sorgt, dass das Stresshormon Noradrenalin länger aktiv bleibt.\"\nVerstehe nun aber nicht, warum Strattera derzeit so hoch gepriesen wird, wenn es doch nur ein Noradrenalin-Wiederaufnahmehemmer ist! Oder ich habe die Zusammenhänge des Artikels nicht ganz verstanden. M.E. ist das mit diesem Strattera wieder so´n Pharmaindustrie-Ding, oder?\nNaja, rege mich halt generell darüber auf, dass wir ADHSler solche Medis selbst bezahlen müssen & dass die, die sowieso (tw. aufgrund ihrer Lebensgeschichte) eh schon keine Kohlen haben, dann nur die eine Möglichkeit haben (Medikinet adult, oder eben einen echt sehr guten, human eingestellten Psychiater).\n27.07.2012, 13:53 #815\n@ Schokominza: In dem Artikel geht es nicht um ADHS, sondern um Stress und seine Auswirkungen. ADHS ist mehr als \"nur\" Stress. Strattera ist ein Medikament gegen ADHS, nicht gegen Stress. Strattera ist kein \"Pharmaindustrie-Ding\". Die Wirksamkeit von Strattera wurde in Studien überprüft.\n27.07.2012, 17:30 #816\n@ Fliegenpilz: Ja, danke. Das hatte ich schon verstanden. Auch, dass es um die Kombi des Stresshormons Cortisol und einem Medi geht, das Noradrenalin länger im syn. Spalt verweilen lässt. Mit Cortisol und dessen Wirkung auf den Körper kenne ich mich recht gut aus. Auch, mit der synthetischen Form dieses Hormons: Dem Kortison.\nAber, was ich NICHT verstanden habe, ist: Warum soll dann ein Medikament, das ein reiner Noradrenalin-Wiederaufnahmehemmer ist (im Umkehrschluss also quasi Stress auslöst) gegen ADHS helfen??\nZu \"...Studien überprüft\": Es gibt zu jeglichem \"Mist\" und auch wirklich \"Nützlichem\" die verschiedensten Studien - das ist für mich also schonmal kein Argument.\nFaktum ist doch, dass es für ADHSler in Deutschland nach wie vor schwierig ist, adäquate bzw.

{"text": "Scripture References are from the ESV translation, copyright 2001.\nTHE heart of the Gospel is redemption, and the essence of redemption is the substitutionary sacrifice of Christ. They who preach this truth preach the Gospel in whatever else they may be mistaken; but they who preach not the atonement, whatever else they declare, have missed the soul and substance of the divine message. In these days, I feel bound to go over and over again the elementary truths of the Gospel. In peaceful times, we may feel free to make excursions into interesting districts of truth that lie far afield; but now we must stay at home and guard the hearths and homes of the church by defending the first principles of the faith. In this age, there have risen up in the church itself men who speak perverse things. There be many that trouble us with their philosophies and novel interpretations, whereby they deny the doctrines they profess to teach and undermine the faith they are pledged to maintain. It is well that some of us, who know what we believe and have no secret meanings for our words, should just put our foot down and maintain our standing, holding forth the Word of life and plainly declaring the foundation truths of the Gospel of Jesus Christ...I have no desire to be famous for anything but preaching the old Gospel. There are plenty who can fiddle to you the new music. It is for me to have no music at any time but that which is heard in heaven: “To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father, to him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen” (Rev 1:5-6).\nI have found, my brethren, by long experience that nothing touches the heart like the cross of Christ. When the heart is touched and wounded by the two-edged sword of the Law, nothing heals its wounds like the balm that flows from the pierced heart of Jesus. The cross is life to the spiritually dead...When we see men quickened, converted, and sanctified by the doctrine of the substitutionary sacrifice, we may justly conclude that it is the true doctrine of atonement. I have not known men made to live unto God and holiness except by the doctrine of the death of Christ on man’s behalf. Hearts of stone that never beat with life before have been turned to flesh through the Holy Spirit causing them to know this truth...The story of the great Lover of the souls of men Who gave Himself for their salvation is still, in the hand of the Holy Ghost, the greatest of all forces in the realm of mind.\nFIRST, THEN, WITH AS MUCH BREVITY AS POSSIBLE, I WILL SPEAK UPON THE GREAT DOCTRINE. The great doctrine, the greatest of all, is this: God, seeing men to be lost by reason of their sin, hath taken that sin of theirs and laid it upon His only begotten Son, making Him to be sin for us, even Him Who knew no sin. In consequence of this transference of sin, he that believeth in Christ Jesus is made just and righteous, yea, is made to be the righteousness of God in Christ. Christ was made sin that sinners might be made righteousness. That is the doctrine of the substitution of our Lord Jesus Christ on the behalf of guilty men.\nNow consider, first, who was made sin for us? The description of our great Surety here given is upon one point only, and it may more than suffice us for our present meditation. Our substitute was spotless, innocent, and pure. “For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin,” Christ Jesus, the Son of God, became incarnate—made flesh—and dwelt here among men; but though He was made in the likeness of sinful flesh, He knew no sin. Though upon Him sin was laid, yet not so as to make Him guilty. He was not, He could not be a sinner: He had no personal knowledge of sin. Throughout the whole of His life, He never committed an offense against the great Law of truth and right. The Law was in His heart. It was His nature to be holy. He could say to all the world, “Which one of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me? ” (John 8:46). Even His vacillating judge enquired, “And he said, “Why, what evil has he done?” (Mat 27:23). When all Jerusalem was challenged and bribed to bear witness against Him, no witnesses could be found. It was necessary to misquote and wrest His words before a charge could be trumped up against Him by His bitterest enemies. His life brought Him in contact with both the Tables of the Law, but no single command had He transgressed. As the Jews examined the Paschal lamb before they slew it, so did scribes and Pharisees, and doctors of the Law, and rulers and princes examine the Lord Jesus without finding offense in Him. He was the Lamb of God, without blemish and without spot.\nAs there was no sin of commission, so was there about our Lord no fault of omission. Probably, dear brethren, we that are believers have been enabled by divine grace to escape most sins of commission; but I for one have to mourn daily over sins of omission. If we have spiritual graces, yet they do not reach the point required of us. If we do that which is right in itself, yet we usually mar our work...either in the motive, in the manner of doing it, or by the self-satisfaction with which we view it when it is done. We come short of the glory of God in some respect or other. We forget to do what we ought to do, or, doing it, we are guilty of lukewarmness, self-reliance, unbelief, or some other grievous error. It was not so with our divine Redeemer. You cannot say that there was any feature deficient in His perfect beauty. He was complete in heart, in purpose, in thought, in word, in deed, in spirit...No pearl has dropped from the silver string of His character. No one virtue has overshadowed and dwarfed the rest: all perfections combine in perfect harmony to make in Him one surpassing perfection.\nNeither did our Lord know a sin of thought. His mind never produced an evil wish or desire. There never was in the heart of our blessed Lord a wish for any evil pleasure, nor a desire to escape any suffering or shame that was involved in His service. When He said, “My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.” He never desired to escape the bitter potion at the expense of His perfect lifework. The “if it be possible” meant “if it be consistent with full obedience to the Father, and the accomplishment of the divine purpose.” We see the weakness of His nature shrinking and the holiness of His nature resolving and conquering as He adds, “nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will” (Mat 26:39). He took upon Him the likeness of sinful flesh, but though that flesh often caused Him weariness of body, it never produced in Him the weakness of sin. He took our infirmities, but He never exhibited an infirmity that had the least of blameworthiness attached to it. Never fell there an evil glance from those blessed eyes. Never did His lips let drop a hasty word. Never did those feet go on an ill errand or those hands move towards a sinful deed. Because His heart was filled with holiness and love within as well as without, our Lord was unblemished. His desires were as perfect as His actions. Searched by the eyes of Omniscience, no shadow of fault could be found in Him.\nYea, more, there were no tendencies about our Substitute towards evil in any form. In us, there are always those tendencies, for the taint of original sin is upon us. We have to govern ourselves and hold ourselves under stern restraint, or we should rush headlong to destruction. Our carnal nature lusteth to evil and needs to be held in as with bit and bridle. Happy is that man who can master himself. But with regard to our Lord, it was His nature to be pure, right, and loving. All His sweet wills were towards goodness. His unconstrained life was holiness itself: He was “the holy child Jesus.” The prince of this world found in Him no fuel for the flame that he desired to kindle. Not only did no sin flow from Him, but there was no sin in Him, or inclination, or tendency in that direction. Watch Him in secret, and you find Him in prayer. Look into His soul, and you find Him eager to do and suffer the Father’s will. Oh, the blessed character of Christ! If I had the tongues of men and of angels, I could not worthily set forth His absolute perfection! Justly may the Father be well pleased with Him! Well may heaven adore Him!\nBeloved, it was absolutely necessary that anyone who should be able to suffer in our stead should himself be spotless. A sinner obnoxious to punishment because of his own offenses—what can he do but bear the wrath that is due to his own sin? Our Lord Jesus Christ as man was made under the Law; but He owed nothing to that Law, for He perfectly fulfilled it in all respects. He was capable of standing in the room, place, and stead of others because He was under no obligations of His own. He was only under obligations towards God because He had voluntarily undertaken to be the surety and sacrifice for those whom the Father gave Him. He was clear Himself, or else He could not have entered into bonds for guilty men.\nOh, how I admire Him! That being such as He was—spotless and thrice holy, so that even the heavens were not pure in His sight, and He charged His angels with folly—yet He condescended to be made sin for us! How could He endure to be numbered with the transgressor and bear the sin of many? It may be no misery for a sinful man to live with sinful men, but it would be a heavy sorrow for the pure-minded to dwell with a company of abandoned and licentious wretches. What an overwhelming sorrow it must have been to the pure and perfect Christ to tabernacle among the hypocritical, the selfish, and the profane! How much worse that He Himself should have to take upon Himself the sins of those guilty men! His sensitive and delicate nature must have shrunk from even the shadow of sin, and yet read the words and be astonished: “He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin.” Our perfect Lord and Master bare our sins in His own body on the tree. He, before Whom the sun itself is dim and the pure azure of heaven is defilement, was made sin. I need not put this in fine words: the fact is itself too grand to need any magnifying by human language. To gild refined gold or paint the lily would be absurd, but much more absurd would it be to try to overlay with flowers of speech the matchless beauties of the cross.\nThe Lord God laid upon Jesus, Who voluntarily undertook it, all the weight of human sin. Instead of its resting on the sinner, who did commit it, it was made to rest upon Christ, Who did not commit it. And the righteousness that Jesus wrought out was placed to the account of the guilty, who had not worked it out, so that the guilty are treated as righteous. Those who by nature are guilty are regarded as righteous, while He who by nature knew no sin whatever was treated as guilty. I think I must have read in scores of books that such a transference is impossible. But the statement has had no effect upon my mind: I do not care whether it is impossible or not with learned unbelievers. It is evidently possible with God, for He has done it. But they say it is contrary to reason. I do not care for that either: it may be contrary to the reason of those unbelievers, but it is not contrary to mine...God saith it and I believe it. And believing it, I find life and comfort in it. Shall I not preach it? Assuredly, I will...Christ was not guilty and could not be made guilty. But He was treated as if He were guilty because He willed to stand in the place of the guilty. Yea, He was not only treated as a sinner, but He was treated as if He had been sin itself in the abstract. This is an amazing utterance! The sinless One was made to be sin.\nSin pressed our great Substitute very sorely. He felt the weight of it in the Garden of Gethsemane, where He sweat “and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground.” (Luke 22:44). The full pressure of it came upon Him when He was nailed to the accursed tree. There in the hours of darkness, He bore infinitely more than we can tell. We know that He bore condemnation from the mouth of man, so that it is written, “and was numbered with the transgressors” (Isa 53:12)...It was a cruel scorn that exhausted itself upon His blessed Person. This, I say, we know. We know that He bore pains innumerable of body and of mind: He thirsted, He cried out in the agony of desertion, He bled, He died. We know that He poured out His soul unto death and yielded up the ghost. But there was at the back, and beyond all this, an immeasurable abyss of suffering. The Greek Liturgy fitly speaks of “Thine unknown sufferings.” Probably to us they are unknowable sufferings. He was God as well as man. The Godhead lent an omnipotent power to the manhood, so that there was compressed within His soul and endured by it an amount of anguish of which we can form no conception...“He made him to be sin.” Look into the words. Perceive their meaning, if you can. The angels desire to look into it. Gaze into this terrible crystal. Let your eyes search deep into this opal, within whose jeweled depth there are flames of fire. The Lord made the perfectly innocent One to be sin for us. That means more of humiliation, darkness, agony, and death than you can conceive! It brought a kind of distraction and well nigh a destruction to the tender and gentle spirit of our Lord. I do not say that our Substitute endured hell: that were unwarrantable. I will not say that He endured either the exact punishment for sin or an equivalent for it. But I do say that what He endured rendered to the justice of God a vindication of His Law clearer and more effectual than would have been rendered to it by the damnation of the sinners for whom He died. The cross is under many aspects a more full revelation of the wrath of God against human sin than even Tophet and the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever, (Rev 14:11). Who would know God’s hate of sin must see the Only Begotten bleeding in body and bleeding in soul even unto death. He must, in fact, spell out each word of my text and read its innermost meaning: “he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God” Oh depth of terror, and yet height of love!...How acceptable with God must those be who are made by God Himself to be “the righteousness of God in him!” I cannot conceive of anything more complete.\nAs Christ was made sin and yet never sinned, so are we made righteousness, though we cannot claim to have been righteous in and of ourselves. Sinners though we be, and forced to confess it with grief, yet the Lord doth cover us so completely with the righteousness of Christ that only His righteousness is seen; and we are made the righteousness of God in Him. This is true of all the saints, even of as many as believe on His name. Oh, the splendor of this doctrine! Canst thou see it, my friend? Sinner though thou be and in thyself defiled, deformed, and debased; yet if thou wilt accept the great Substitute that God provides for thee in the Person of His dear Son, thy sins are gone from thee, and righteousness has come to thee. Thy sins were laid on Jesus, the scapegoat! They are thine no longer; He has put them away. I may say that His righteousness is imputed unto thee; but I go further and say with the text, “Thou art made the righteousness of God in him.” No doctrine can be more sweet than this to those who feel the weight of sin and the burden of its curse.", "url": "https://mbrem123.com/jesus/heartofthegospel.php"}

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180423006231/en/\nTechnavio has published a new market research report on the global iron oxide pigments market from 2018-2022. (Graphic: Business Wire)\nIncreasing demand for nano-iron oxide pigments is a key trend which is expected to impact the market outlook over the forecast period. Leading vendors are increasingly investing in R&D to capture a large proportion of market shares through new product introductions. The incorporation of potential materials such as nanoparticles in coatings and other technologies is a relatively new concept in the market. The demand for nano-sized iron oxide pigments is increasing in the construction, coating, and cosmetics end-user industries.\nThis report is available at a USD 1,000 discount for a limited time only:\nSave more with Technavio. Buy2 reports and get the third for FREE:\nIn this report, Technavio analysts highlight increasing offshore exploration and production investments as a key factor contributing to the growth of the global iron oxide pigments market:\nIncreasing offshore exploration and production investments\nThe increase in the demand for energy and the depletion of onshore reserves have made oil and gas companies invest significantly in offshore oil and gas reserves. The rising drilling activities and the high demand from the offshore rigs and floating production storage and offloading are likely to foster the demand for iron oxide pigments. These pigments are used as lubricants in oil drilling rigs and as catalysts in the petroleum industry.\nIncreasing offshore activities and construction projects are fueling the consumption of oil and gas, thereby driving the demand for iron oxide pigments. Moreover, these iron-based automotive coatings are widely used in OEM components such as cylinder heads, crankcases, transmission housings, engine blocks, pumps, bearings, suspension systems, bodywork parts, and wheels (with both exterior and interior furnishings).\n“Also, the increased demand for automotive coatings is expected to drive the global iron oxide pigments market during the forecast period. Different types of iron oxide pigments (based on the particle size) are used, including micaceous, opaque, and transparent pigments. These transparent iron oxide pigments are widely used, owing to their various benefits such as the reduction in the coloring cost, improved transparency, UV absorption, and color consistency,” says a senior analyst at Technavio for research.\nLooking for more information on this market?\nTechnavio’s sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report such as the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more.\nGlobal iron oxide pigments market segmentation\nThis market research report segments the by product (synthetic iron oxide pigments and natural iron oxide pigments), by end-user (construction, paints and coatings, foundry, industrial chemicals, and others) and key regions (APAC, Europe, North America, and ROW).\nOf the four major end-user segments, the construction segment held the largest market share in 2017, accounting for over 53% of the market, followed by the paints and coatings segment.\nIn terms of geography, APAC held the largest market share accounting for close to 45%, followed by Europe, North America, and ROW. Also, APAC is expected to emerge as the only region that will witness a growth in its market share over the forecast period. The market share of all the other three regions is expected to dip by 2022.\nAbout Technavio\nis a leading global technology research and advisory company.

The five-time All-Star is consulting with surgeons in New York, and it's possible he'll undergo an operation as early as Thursday. Love, who could miss two months, already has screws in the hand from a previous procedure after he broke it in 2009 with Minnesota.\nWhile he's out, the Cavs have to hold themselves together.\nGoran Dragic scored 18 and Josh Richardson 15 to lead the Heat, who went just 3 of 28 on 3-pointers.\nMiami had a last chance after Cleveland's Kyle Korver made one of two free throws with seven seconds left, but Heat forward James Johnson, harassed by James on the baseline, couldn't get off a shot before the horn sounded.\nThe Cavs have been enveloped in drama all season. There have been injuries, blowout losses, persistent trade rumors and more story lines than a day-time soap opera.\n\"As The Land Turns,\" coach Tyronn Lue said with a sigh following his pregame media availability.\nThe chaos could continue, but for at least one night things didn't get any worse for the Cavs, who went 6-8 in January and have been plagued by shoddy defense.\nIt was the first time they've held a team under 90 points since Nov. 20.\nDespite going just 1 of 16 on 3-pointers, Miami overcame a 14-point deficit to take a 50-48 lead at halftime.\nTIP-INS\nHeat: The tragic death of former NBA player Rasual Butler devastated Miami coach Erik Spoelstra and forward Udonis Haslem. Butler was drafted by Miami and played three seasons there. \"I'm shocked. It's horrible, horrible news for all of us,\" said Spoelstra, who got emotional talking about Butler, who was killed along with his wife in a single-vehicle rollover in Los Angeles. \"He's one of our favorite people that's come through the organization.\" Haslem is the only player left with the Heat who played with Butler. \"Blindsided me,\" he said. \"I immediately took to Rasual when I got here. Another competitor, guy like myself, fearless. We just hung out a lot.\" ... Miami fell to 17-6 when holding opponents under 100 points.\nCavaliers: James committed six of his seven turnovers in the first half and didn't get his first assist until 11:16 remained in the third quarter. ... Lue started Crowder because he wanted to match up with Johnson, but Cleveland's lineup could change on a game-to-game basis. ... James has scored in double digits in 841 consecutive games — 25 shy of Michael Jordan's record. ... In the loss at Detroit, James (10,932) passed Dirk Nowitzki (10,917) for eighth place on the career field goals list. Next up is Elvin Hayes (10,976).\nUP NEXT\nHeat: Continue a four-game trip Friday in Philadelphia.\nCavaliers: Host the Houston Rockets on Saturday.\n___\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball", "url": "https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3355136"}

On Wednesday, however, Scotland Yard referred media calls to Wiltshire police.\nThe statement from Wiltshire Police came only a month after police from 40 departments in England and Wales returned home after months of working on the Skripals' poisoning. Wiltshire Police spent about 7.5 million pounds ($10 million) dealing with the aftermath of the Skripals' poisoning and believe that his front door was contaminated with the nerve agent.\nSergei Skripal, 66, is a former Russian intelligence officer who was convicted of spying for Britain before coming to the U.K. as part of a 2010 prisoner swap.

It is a beautiful area of New York and Ommegang is like an oasis worth visiting!\nStopped on the way to NH. We were really pressed for time so we couldn't go on the tour or hang out. We were hungry so we decide to get something quick to eat. Belgian beers are typically not my style but they paired well with the cheese soup we had. They have a gift shop where you can buy the usual offerings. We purchased a few bottles & a heavy duty bottle opener. I'd like to stop here again when we have time to take the tour.\nOmmegang is an interesting brewery located near Cooperstown, and is a very worthwhile stop for anyone in the area. I was there over the summer, and it was very crowded so we didn't go on a tour.\nEven while tasting, people were lined several layers deep at the bar. It was a bit overly hectic, and made the whole process less enjoyable than it could have been. The beers, though, were all good and interesting. I'd just suggest visiting on a day when it isn't going to be as crowded.\nThe primary is an open fermentation process in the traditional Belgian style. Before being transferred to the secondary, they top harvest the yeast. The beer is then lagered at 32deg F for two weeks- rather unusual for an ale. At this point, it's back to the basics- warm the beer, add the harvested yeast and sugar, and bottle condition.\nBoth the store and cafe offered all of the Ommegang beers plus a sampling of their \"sister\" beers from other Duvel owned breweries. Very nice selection.\nThe food was good, but rather pricey. The service was great, but being the end of November, it wasn't very busy. The staff was very knowledgeable and friendly.\nA very cool and very different brewery located in rural upstate NY. Brewing based on Belgian styles. Not my most favourite styles of beer, but what they do here they do very well. The tour was free and the guides were very knowledgeable, especially regarding what makes them different from other breweries as well as about the history of the company. It was also nice because the tour group was relatively small so it was easy to ask questions.\nWell this brewery doesn't need to be propped up. It is Ommegang! The day I was there it was crowded and can get cramped in the tasting room.\nGreat little tour with plenty of samples of all there styles afterwards. It has a nice gift shop with all the Belgian beer six packs, four packs and 750ml bottles. Also t-shirts, glasses including the \"Duvel Tulip\"\nIt located outside of Cooperstown so it would be a nice side trip if visiting the BB hall of fame.", "url": "https://beermapping.com/location/215"}

{"text": "Revolve Clothing, an increasingly popular Los Angeles-based fashion e-commerce business, is the latest such retailer to fall victim to layoffs, even as the company’s profits continue to grow. Earlier this month, Revolve announced a round of layoffs in the photo department of its Cerritos headquarters, and sources who spoke to Jezebel believe the company’s seemingly endless budget for mega influencer events—including a Kim Kardashian appearance in the Hamptons—may be coming at the expense of those jobs.\nTwo Revolve employees (both spoke to me over the phone under the condition of anonymity to avoid penalty) said Revolve co-founder Mike Karanikolas held a meeting on June 17 and announced that the company was laying off the majority of its photo editing team—which is responsible for acquiring and editing photos and editorials that appear on the site—to save on operational costs.\nOne staff member also said people who lost their jobs were offered severance packages that will only be issued if they remain at Revolve until their official termination date, which is months down the line. Some employees will stay on until September, while others will remain until November or January, after which their jobs will be outsourced to workers in another country (two employees, one current and one former, specifically said the Philippines). Employees appear to be cautious about publicly discussing the layoffs to avoid jeopardizing their future severance.\nIn June, we notified a small number of employees that they will likely be let go between the months of September and January, as we shift certain work to a 3rd party provider. All affected employees were provided at least several months advance notice, and all were additionally provided severance packages including salary and health coverage, as well as assistance locating other career opportunities. While fewer than ten employees were affected by the changes, we sympathize with their situation, and are doing our best to assist them going forward.\nWe don’t anticipate any other operational changes of this nature and the company will continue to hire and build the team as the business continues to grow.\nExpenditures relating to sales and marketing efforts are generally unrelated to operational decisions, and are necessary for the continued successful operation of REVOLVE, which employs hundreds of individuals. We generally do not comment on marketing expenditures, but we will say in this case the information reported by the press was inaccurate.\nThe inaccuracy she’s referring to are reports that Kim Kardashian was paid $700,000 to host a Revolve Hamptons event this summer. According to the laid-off employees I spoke to, it’s the optics of excess spending that make the layoffs feel more offensive. Perhaps what’s happening is an overlap of their personal disappointment about losing a job and the natural effects of a company that’s prioritizing public image.\nStill, like other fashion outlets, Revolve relies heavily on celebrities and influencers for a marketing boost. Nicole Richie collaborated on a line, stars like Kendall and Kylie Jenner have sold a collection on their site, and style bloggers are frequently sent on trips to promote the brand. Such events have become the lifeblood of Revolve.\nIn addition to taking care of their travel and accommodations, Revolve gifted each influencer with a sizable clothing credit — a source close to the participating talent tells us $2,000 is standard — in addition to paying his or her appearance fee. And for certain agency-backed bloggers, like Bernstein and Bazan, who are both represented by Next Models, this can easily run in the tens of thousands of dollars.\nThe first Revolve employee I spoke to who was part of the layoffs told me the company’s decision to hire Kardashian angered staff members who’d been let go. Kim reportedly spent an hour at the party, where she was seen “taking numerous selfies with influencers,” Page Six reported.\nAlso in attendance were fashion insiders like stylist Chriselle Lim, blogger Arielle Charnas and DJ Amy Pham.\nGerona responded to my question about the Kardashian event in her email above with: “Expenditures relating to sales and marketing efforts are generally unrelated to operational decisions, and are necessary for the continued successful operation of REVOLVE.” Gerona also declined to comment on how much Kardashian was paid for the event.\nWhy the huge cost for Kardashian’s brief appearance? It’s all part of Revolve’s big picture marketing strategy to show clothes in context so customers aspire to wear them — and in turn, buy them. (Google recently released a study that found this tactic influences 64 percent of women to make a purchase on their smartphones.)

What's the purpose of having 2 separate Program Files directories anyway?</p>\n\n<p>Every program I've installed has gone into the <code>C:\\Program Files (x86)</code> folder. It doesn't seem to matter if the app is 32 or 64 bit. <strong>Why don't 64-bit apps get placed in <code>C:\\Program Files</code>?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Is there a way to change the default to be <code>C:\\Program Files</code> instead? <strong>Would it mess anything up if I just put everything into <code>C:\\Program Files</code>?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>If indeed there is some benefit to having a separate folder for 64 bit apps, it seems like the more sensible default would have been to use <code>C:\\Program Files</code> for x86 apps and create a new <code>C:\\Program Files (x64)</code> folder for the new 64-bit apps. This would help maintain backwards compatibility. I work as a software developer and some of my projects contain path references to libraries under <code>C:\\Program Files</code>. Now those references are broken on the Windows 7 machine that has placed them in <code>C:\\Program Files (x86)</code>. I even tried to change the target location in the installer to be <code>C:\\Program Files</code>, but that was ignored and the app went into <code>C:\\Program Files (x86)</code> anyway.</p>\n\n<p>This is very frustrating because I need to share source code between 32 and 64 bit machines and I don't want to have to mess with some configuration file that sets the path to these libraries differently on different machines.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit regarding environment variables:</strong> (Using only default English values of variables for simplicity.) On a 64-bit machine <code>%ProgramFiles%</code> will be <code>C:\\Program Files</code> while the brand new variable <code>%ProgramFiles(x86)%</code> will be <code>C:\\Program Files (x86)</code>. So, if you have a 32-bit program that needs to find the folder path that it would be installed under, it would need to check to see if it was running on a 32-bit or a 64-bit version of Windows in order to know which environment variable to use. Any 32-bit apps that were written without this consideration would need to be updated in order to work correctly on a 64-bit machine. So even using environment variables, the backwards compatibility is broken.</p>\n\n<p>Also, <code>%ProgramFiles(x86)%</code> doesn't exist on 32-bit versions of Windows. If it did, then 32-bit apps could just always use that environment variable and wouldn't need any conditional logic based on which OS they're running on.</p>\n\n<p>The reason for this is simply many older installers either do not understand the new file structure and plonk everything in the standard program files directory or you are looking at a smart program that has a few 32-bit components which are being copied there.</p>\n\n<p>Your best bet is to download a new program - such as <a href=\"http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">x64 Winrar</a> and just see where it installs to just to rule out a problem with your machine.</p>\n\n<p>As for messing stuff up - it can, but it really depends on the program, there is no one answer fits all... some smaller, compact programs with just a few files should have no problem, where as, if you talk about Office, Adobe or any other \"suite\" or large program, it will most likely fail as they have many shared components that are cross architecture.</p>\n", "url": null}

{"text": "Originally posted on Massapequa Dad.\nLast month, my wife posted on her blog about how we were beginning our journey with XSport Massapequa fitness center and our new healthy eating lifestyle. Yes, it seems every few months we return to that healthy eating lifestyle, and although we never really go off it, we do tend to slip up and need to recoup. Today marks a month since we started at XSport in Massapequa (in Sunrise Mall) and we are still going strong!\nAs of this morning, I am down 11 pounds. My wife is down 6 pounds. We have been going to the gym religiously, even through my step-father’s hospitalization (he is still hospitalized but thankfully on the mend). Some days we go early in the morning, other days we go in the afternoons (the kids like to go to the gym childcare so they can play and wrestle and make new friends), and for the first time last night, we went in the evening.\nI have to say that the only time we’ve encountered the gym to be too busy for our liking is in the immediate after work hours, like 5pm and a little later. I was pleasantly surprised that although there were a lot of members last night, it was not packed, and both of us had an easy time finding a machine. Everything is immaculate, and we are ALWAYS seeing the cleaning crew at work, no matter what time we go.\nThe team is all so friendly and helpful. The assistant manager, Pete, who set us up a month ago, is friendly, helpful and very accommodating. His boss, manager Steve, is just as accommodating. The trainers are great. Both my wife and I see Tristan: I go twice a week, she goes once a week. He is tailoring our workouts individually, keeping each of our needs in mind. Jen loves the gentle pushes, and I am amazed with how much progress I am seeing in just one month. He is always available by text to help motivate, inspire or assist, and this is huge for us. Thanks guys!\nWe have met some of the other trainers as well, and even those we have not officially yet met, we are becoming friendly with. We are starting to see familiar faces as we keep coming back, and periodically, we see some of our neighbors and those we know from the area. Neither of us feel pressured, out of place or anything but comfortable. We are very happy with our decision to join XSport.\nOur next step is to try out an XIt class. Armondo is the manager, and from what we’ve learned, XIt is a 1-hour Interval Training Class that constantly monitors your heart rate to ensure that you reach your maximum level, allowing your body to continue to burn calories and fat for up to 36 hours after class. Intervals include free weights, rowing, TRX workouts and so much more! Here is the current Massapequa XIt schedule.\nIf you visit the gym, be sure to say Paul and Jennifer from Massapequa Dad and Massapequa Family sent you!\nThe post One month in, still going strong XSport Massapequa #xsport #massapequa appeared first on Massapequa Mom & Dad.", "url": "http://massapequafamily.com/2016/01/one-month-in-still-going-strong-xsport-massapequa-xsport-massapequa/"}

Sci. 2018;59(9):1649.\nPurpose : Nitric oxide (NO) relaxes the trabecular meshwork, increases outflow facility and lowers intraocular pressure. As opposed to direct treatment using NO-donating compounds, priming sensitivity of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) to NO may provide more efficacious therapeutic benefits as sGC stimulators work synergistically with endogenous NO to amplify cGMP production. The goal of the present study was to investigate the synergistic relationship between the sGC stimulator, IWP-953 and NO in trabecular meshwork (TM) cell models.\nMethods : Methods: To determine IWP-953 and NO synergy on sGC activity in 3 different confluent strains of human TM cells, we measured intracellular cGMP to generate a concentration-response curve for low fixed concentration of IWP-953 (1 or 10 µM) with escalating DETA-NO concentrations (10 pM-1mM). Synergistic effects of IWP-953/NO on TM cellular contraction was measured using two methods, a gel contraction assay and phosphorylation status of myosin light chain (pMLC) by Western blot.\nResults : Results: Using a fixed dose of IWP-953 in the cGMP assay, the average EC50 in the 3 cell strains for DETA-NO was 98.1 μM in the presence of 1 μM IWP-953 and 20.9 µM in the presence of 10 μM IWP-953. Similarly, the combination of 10 μM IWP-953 and 1 μM DETA-NO was equally efficacious as 100μM DETA-NO alone in relaxing TM cells and decreasing proportion of MLC that was phosphorylated.\nConclusions : Conclusions: These data indicate that IWP-953 synergistically works with NO to modulate the sGC-cGMP pathway and relax human TM cells. By restoring physiological levels of cellular contraction/relaxation to the TM, sGC stimulators may stop or reverse the cell contraction-induced fibrosis in glaucomatous tissues that is thought to contribute to outflow dysfunction.", "url": "https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2690030"}

{"text": "Sexual misconduct allegations against Gonzales pastor \"not subst - WAFB 9 News Baton Rouge, Louisiana News, Weather, Sports\n\nThe Diocese of Baton Rouge said Saturday that accusations of sexual misconduct against a Gonzales pastor could not be substantiated.\nOn Nov. 8, 2017, the diocese received a complaint against Father Eric Gyan, currently pastor of St. Theresa of Avila Parish in Gonzales. The misconduct was alleged to have taken place in 1996 when the victim was a minor and Gyan was pastor of St. John the Baptist Parish in Brusly.\nThe diocese says this is only such complaint they've ever received about Gyan.\nThe diocese said they notified \"civil officials\" of the allegation, which is in accordance with the diocese's policy for what to do when an allegation is made regarding sexual abuse of minors by an employee. The diocese also informed the woman making the allegation that she had the right to reach out to \"civil officials\" as well.\nAccording to the release, trained professional laypersons were appointed by the diocese to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the matter. The Independent Review Board of the diocese was also notified. After the investigation, the Independent Review Board said the allegation against Fr. Gyan could not be substantiated.\nThe Diocese says this process found no reason to remove Fr. Gyan from ministry at any time. They also said Fr. Gyan was cooperative and categorically denied the allegation.\nBishop Muench has now accepted the findings and recommendations presented to him. Fr. Gyan continues to serve as a priest in good standing and of good reputation.\nCopyright 2017 WAFB.

{"text": "Syria envoy says Geneva talks to focus on transition\n\nThe U.N. envoy to Syria says negotiating a political transition for the war-torn country will be the sole item on the agenda for upcoming talks between the government and opposition in Geneva.\nStaffan De Mistura emphatically rejected any change to the agenda, saying it would open a \"Pandora's box\" of stalling and time-wasting.\n\"Geneva will not be about the procedure, but about the future,\" he told reporters in joint press conference with Italian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano, in Rome.\nThe envoy said the agenda is fixed in U.N. Security Council Resolution 2254, which mandates a new form of governance for Syria, a new constitution, and new elections. The resolution was adopted unanimously by the Security Council in 2015.\nThe Syrian government has previously rejected such formulations, complicating efforts aimed at ending the conflict. The government holds the upper hand in Syria more than a year after a sweeping Russian intervention turned the tide of the nearly six-year war in its favor.\nThe envoy urged the opposition to present a unified front at Geneva, in order to deprive the government of the \"alibi\" that it doesn't know who the opposition is.\nThe Geneva talks, slated for Feb. 23, are expected to bring together representatives from President Bashar Assad's government with exiled opposition figures and rebels fighting inside Syria.\nBut some of Syria's rebels say they won't begin negotiating a political settlement with the government until measures are taken to bolster a flagging cease-fire and address urgent humanitarian concerns.\nMohammad Alloush, a rebel leader who is representing the opposition at talks this week in Kazakhstan, said he will insist on discussing the Dec. 30 cease-fire. The talks in the Kazakh capital, Astana, are intended to pave the way for next week's revival of the Geneva process, which has been on hold since last April.\nThe Kazakhstan talks are brokered by Russia and Turkey, which back opposing sides in the war and have taken the lead with peace efforts since December. The Syrian government delegation met with the Russian delegation in Astana on Wednesday, Syrian state TV reported.\nRussia and Iran, close allies of President Bashar Assad, and Turkey, which backs the rebels, previously pledged to enforce the cease-fire, but both sides have alleged repeated violations. A round of talks in Astana last month ended inconclusively.\nThe rebels say they are awaiting a reply from Russia to a list of requests concerning the observation and enforcement of the cease-fire.\n\"The paper we presented on 23 January is the basis for talks today,\" Alloush told the AP by phone on his way to Astana.\nThe Kazakhstan talks were supposed to begin Wednesday but were postponed by one day. The Kazakh Foreign Ministry did not give a reason for the delay. The Geneva talks are scheduled for Feb. 23.\nSyria's Foreign Ministry meanwhile rejected a Human Rights Watch report accusing government forces of mounting at least eight chemical attacks using chlorine gas on opposition-held residential areas during the final months in last year's battle for the northern city of Aleppo. The report was published on Monday.\n———\nAssociated Press cameraman Gianfranco Stara in Rome and AP writer Albert Aji in Damascus, Syria contributed to this report.", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/kazakhstan-postpones-syria-talks-day-45505276"}

A quiet, tight-knit community where neighbors said the only problem they ever had with the suspect’s family was over a parking spot.\nNeighbors said Ullah lived in the basement of the brick multi-family home near Avenue N for at least the last 5 years. They said his mother, father, and brother — who has his own wife and child –lived in the unit upstairs.\nRoss Fiallace said he saw cops speaking with the family Monday morning.\n“They just pulled the whole family out of the house for questioning. They just quietly, no emotion, just out into the car and that’s it,” he said.\nA few hours before Ullah’s alleged pipe bomb attack near the bus terminal, neighbor Kisslyn Joseph said she heard someone pacing outside, swearing on the phone.\n“It was a heated argument, it was 2 o’clock, 3 o’clock in the morning,” she said.\nCops said Ullah is from Bangladesh and came to the U.S. in 2011 on an immigrant visa. He eventually became a permanent resident.\nNeighbor Alan Butrico said he was a for hire driver and drove a black sedan that constantly blocked his driveway.\n“He was nasty. We told him to move the car, it felt like he owned it,” he said.\nOthers said he was a loner, who rarely said hello.\n“Not, not him, but the rest of the family, yes,” George Sciarrone said.\nNone of the behavior lead anyone to believe they lived next to an alleged terrorist.\n“Just because we had an argument, I wouldn’t think that.

{"text": "Moise Kean was on target for the fourth Serie A game on the bounce, but SPAL fought back for a 2-1 victory to postpone the Juventus Scudetto party.\nThe Bianconeri needed just one point to be sure of their eighth consecutive Scudetto, with a record six rounds to spare, so with the Champions League quarter-final against Ajax coming up on Tuesday, Max Allegri rested numerous stars. Juan Cuadrado and Andrea Barzagli made their comebacks after long injury lay-offs, with 17-year-old defender Paolo Gozzi getting his Serie A debut. SPAL were hovering above the relegation zone, but Jasmin Kurtic was not fit enough to start, so Pasquale Schiattarella stepped in.\nAlessandro Murgia’s overhead kick didn’t quite work out and Paulo Dybala had a shot charged down, but SPAL started to take control of proceedings.\nMohamed Fares and Andrea Petagna had efforts deflected during the same sweeping right-to-left move, while on the resulting corner Barzagli’s defending prevented Petagna nodding in from six yards.\nJuventus took the lead somewhat against the run of play, as Joao Cancelo cut inside from the right and his daisy-cutter was going wide, but Kean found himself in the vicinity and stuck out a foot to redirect from 12 yards, wrong-footing Emiliano Viviano. It was the 19-year-old Italy international’s fourth consecutive Serie A match on target, his sixth in a row between club and country. He also became the youngest player to score in four Serie A games on the bounce in the three points for a win era.\nAnother Dybala curler from the edge of the box was charged down, while Sergio Floccari couldn’t steer his header on target.\nSPAL came out fighting for the second half and Kevin Bonifazi’s downward header from a corner at the near post put them on level terms.\nThe hosts continued to pour forward, notching up a series of corners and pinning Juve back into their own half. Murgia’s header was too weak and straight at Mattia Perin on a floated Lazzari cross, but Hans Nicolussi-Caviglia stung Viviano’s gloves from distance.\nHowever, SPAL turned the game around completely when Murgia used his chest to intercept a pass on the edge of the area, rolled across for Floccari and the veteran striker swept into the far bottom corner from 12 yards. It was his first Serie A goal of the season.\nThis result would postpone the Scudetto party, so Juve threw on Federico Bernardeschi and poured forward, but deep into stoppages his free kick was nodded wide by Mattia De Sciglio.\nThese are three precious points to keep SPAL away from the drop zone and they become only the second Serie A team to beat Juventus this season.\nIt is still possible Juventus could win the Scudetto this weekend if Napoli fail to beat bottom of the table Chievo.", "url": "https://www.football-italia.net/SerieA/match/125379"}

{"text": "I have done a lot of substitute teaching. One of the things about being a sub is that you are only sort of a teacher. Just sort of. You can assign work, and take up papers, you can help people with their assignments and answer questions (if you are familiar enough with the subject). But day-to-day substitutes never really evaluate students, one of the primary tasks of every teacher. We can pass on that a student didn't seem to understand a particular topic, but we rarely grade papers or homework. We don't create tests designed measure a student's comprehension of what has been taught in class. We can give instruction, but it is always very limited instruction because we don't know the broader context in which the teacher has been instructing the students over the previous weeks. Substitutes can help but they can't really replace the teacher.\nSometimes, in our daily walks, though, we are all too ready to replace one of our best teachers, the Word of God (with guidance from the Holy Spirit) with a substitute. We take time to listen to good preachers on the radio or on TV because we can catch them when it is convenient. We read short devotionals (hey, nothing wrong with those!). We listen to Christian music and go to concerts. We read books on Christian living by famous pastors and authors. But, on their own, each of those things amounts to nothing more than, maybe, a good substitute teacher. Their power and influence are extremely limited when compared to the power of the Word of God. \"For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart\" (Hebrews 4:12, NIV).\nAll of these other resources can be excellent aids in our daily instruction and communion with God, but they are incomplete and weak on their own. Hopefully, each of these aids take their clues from God's Word (I know I try to center each devotional there) but they are all subject to their incredibly corruptible and fickle human authors, and even when they are not, none of them have the power to \"judge the thoughts and attitudes of the heart\" as effectively or as powerfully as the undiluted Word of God when the power of the Holy Spirit works in our hearts.\nI am flattered you have taken the time to read this and I hope that this devotional aids you in your walk. But if you have to choose between making time for this or any other aid and the pure, unpolluted power of God's Word, I hope you choose the latter. Nothing else can penetrate our hearts as deeply or as powerfully. Keep around the aids that you use (like Stickler's Musings) but make sure they don't become a substitute for the real thing.", "url": "http://www.sticklersmusings.com/2018/03/relying-on-only-sort-of-teacher.html"}

{"text": "WASHINGTON — When I lived in Cambodia, I got into a lot of fights. I’d protest the fruit seller who was overcharging me for mangoes because I was American. I’d wave my hands at the police officer who fined me for driving on the correct side of the road. I’d get angry with doctors at the “free” clinic for charging poor patients for drugs.\nMy Cambodian boyfriend usually just watched and shook his head.\nBut when we went to the Justice Ministry to get papers for his U.S. visa application, he told me not to fight. Not this time. Just go with it, he said, as he handed money to the clerk to get his papers the same day.\nIt made me wonder, why do people accept corruption that’s exploiting them? Why defend a government that runs off bribes or nepotism?\n“We rationalize the status quo because it reassures us that things are under control and we’re going to be able to have a predictable life,” says Justin Friesen, a doctoral candidate at Ontario’s University of Waterloo and co-author of “Why Do People Defend Unjust, Inept and Corrupt Systems,” published in Current Directions in Psychological Science.\nIn Cambodia, that might mean paying an extra “service charge” to power company officials to make sure your lights stay on. In the United States, it could mean staying silent when your coworkers are overcharging clients or lying on their timesheets to earn money for hours they didn’t work.\nBasically, people want to keep things calm. And if you’re not protesting the problem, the likelihood that you’re a part of it grows.\nAccording to Lamar Pierce, associate professor at the Washington University in St. Louis, two major factors contribute to corruption: Economic motivation and self-serving biases.\n“If taking bribes are a function of how much you can feed your kid, then often that is the overwhelming motivator,” Pierce says of the first factor.\nBut the second factor, to which we all fall prey, is more complex.\n“If people are able to convince themselves quite irrationally that what they’re doing is really okay, it’s not their fault, it’s not hurting anyone, that they’re not going to get caught, that’s where you get situations like the subprime crisis,” he says, referring to the U.S. financial crisis in which profit-hungry lenders approved mortgage loans to people who couldn’t afford them.\nIt’s even easier for people to ignore the desire to be good if they cheat “by a little bit” rather than to the maximum extent possible, according to Francesca Gino, an associate professor at Harvard Business School and the author of Sidetracked: Why Our Decisions Get Derailed, and How We Can Stick to the Plan.\n“The very simple metrics that people intuitively tend to do are very helpful as a first-line defense,” Pierce says.\nThe second-line defense? Ask yourself about the consequences of your actions.\n“Is there an ethical component to this? Who is this going to harm? Who is this going to benefit? Is it going to violate any rules?\"\nIt's a five to 10-second check, Pierce says, that can mean the difference between right and wrong.", "url": "https://www.voacambodia.com/a/corruption-psychology/1559686.html"}

{"text": "Trial starts for woman charged with killing her twin\n\nWAILUKU, Hawaii (AP) — A murder trial began Monday for a woman accused of deliberately driving off a cliff in Hawaii and killing her identical twin sister.\nThe 2016 crash was a tragic accident, Alexandria Duval's defense attorney, Birney Bervar said in his opening statement. There's reasonable doubt of any criminal behavior, he said.\nAuthorities described the 2016 crash as a hair-pulling fight over the steering wheel. The sisters, who were 38 at the time, were seen arguing on the narrow, winding Hana Highway on the island of Maui before their SUV plunged 200 feet over a cliff.\nAnastasia Duval was in the passenger seat and was killed, and her sister Alexandria Duval was arrested. A judge later ordered Alexandria Duval released after finding no probable cause for a murder charge. She traveled to upstate New York and was arrested again months later in Albany after a grand jury indicted her.\nDuval opted to have a judge instead of a jury decide the case. The judge is expected to reach a verdict this week.\nMaui resident Chad Smith testified that while the women were passing him on the highway he could see them arguing. Smith, who was headed to a church, said he couldn't hear anything but the women looked angry. He had to swerve out of their way, he said.\nThe sisters, born Alison and Ann Dadow in the Utica, New York, area, operated popular yoga studios in Florida before they changed their names. They moved to Hawaii in 2015 from Utah.\nDuval isn't expected to testify, Bervar said.", "url": "https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3354051"}

The 50-year-old left behind heirs that include his mother and three children.\nJackson died of acute intoxication of propofol, a prescription anesthetic he had been taking as a sleep aid during preparations for a series of comeback concerts.\nFormer cardiologist Conrad Murray was convicted in 2011 of involuntary manslaughter for giving Jackson a fatal dose of the drug. He served two years in jail, and his conviction was upheld in 2014.\n___\nFollow Andrew Dalton on Twitter: https://twitter.com/andyjamesdalton .\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He sought to develop a balanced education for the “whole child,” one which would engage the child’s feeling and will as well as thinking, and would leave his or her inner nature acknowledged, but free.\nThe impulse for Waldorf education, as it came to be called, spread throughout Europe, with the first school in America being founded in New York City in 1928.

{"text": "Opel at the factory in the German city of Eisenach has launched an assembly line for the production of the new three-door car model Adam. North American concern of General Motors has invested in the modernization of the plant, where today a model of Corsa is produced, a total of ? 190 million. It has been very difficult to manage all about the assembly of the new premium hatchback of the Opel company, as the German company has developed a model for an extensive program of personalization: the choice of the potential buyers are 61,000 exterior design options and 82,000 interior design possibilities.\nOpel intends to put its hand on a new and quite thrilling project – to restyle their standard version of the model Corsa. Up till now no one could actually expect this, but recently everything was revealed as the new interesting Corsa was spotted by the auto-photo-spies on the public roads. The main changes will be the front of the car, the car will get the grille and headlights style of the car model of ADAM. According to the official sources, novelty will be present at the motor show in Geneva in March.\nOpel Antara crossover of the second generation will be released by the Opel company not sooner than in 2014. This information was provided by the official sources, that say that this timing is not accidental, as company is having pretty tough but quite promising and optimistic plans about gaining back the previous and popular position of the brand.\nAs small cars are now becoming really a hit of the season, some car critics are projecting a pretty bad situation for Opel in the upcoming years. Though Opel / Vauxhall are confident that they can produce a new minicar in Germany and still make a profit.", "url": "http://opelgo.com/2013/01/page/2"}

{"text": "Lisa Park is an interdisciplinary artist living in New York City and Seoul, South Korea.\nShe received her BFA in Fine Arts Media from the Art Center College of Design, Pasadena, California. She also holds an MPS from the Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts.\nOn her own website, Lisa Park said she \"has been working with biofeedback devices (heart rate sensors, commercial brainwave headsets) to display auditory and visual representations of physiological measurements. These performances explored the possibilities of self-monitoring her physical and psychological states.\"\nFor example, she did some works visualizing emotive states and the subconscious. In Eunoia and Eunoia II, she controlled pools of water with her brain-waves. This was done by using electroencephalography (E.E.G.) data to create sound-waves which were pushed through pools of water, causing them to ripple. Park sat in the center of the pools as this occurred. For Eunoia, Park separated the E.E.G. data into five emotions, each of which fed into one of five pools of water. For Eunoia II, she expanded her conception of brain activity to cover forty-eight pools of water, matching the forty-eight emotions described by philosopher Baruch Spinoza. Also, while Park strove to control her emotions in Eunoia in order to keep the pools of water still, she changed her approach in Eunoia II to focus on expressing emotions.\nShe collaborated with fellow student Adria Navarro to create \"I Wish I Said Hello,\" a work that used physical locations mentioned in classifieds such as Craigslist to map out places where people missed connecting with each other.\nIn 2017 she participated in \"Flatland: A Journey of Many Dimensions\", a group exhibition at the Mana Contemporary in Miami, Florida.\nPark was a member at the New Museum's by-application-only incubator, NEW INC, from 2015 to 2017. Park was selected to be an artist-in-residence at Nokia Bell Labs in 2017 as part of their Experiments in Art and Technology residency program with NEW INC. As part of the residency, Park was commissioned to create, \"Blooming,\" which was featured in the exhibition Only Human at Mana Contemporary in May 2017 and written up in Wired.

{"text": "Shortly after my move from New York to Alabama, I was sitting alone at our local Italian restaurant, reading magazines. After a while, a couple who’d been sitting across the room approached and introduced themselves to me. That couple, Jennifer and Robert Rausch, quickly became fixtures in my life; they’ve remained integral members of my Alabama family since that day.\nThese days, you can find Jennifer overseeing the day-to-day operations of the new flagship store and café at The Factory. She agreed to work with us at just the right time. The company was growing and I needed someone I could trust to help me make decisions that were thoughtful and confident. Growing a company can make one feel vulnerable; having an old friend there for support (especially one with an incredible work ethic) put me a bit more at ease.\nShe moves effortlessly between tasks and has a real desire to connect with everyone who walks through our door. This genuine approach, coupled with her wicked, infectious laugh, drew me to her initially and continues to make me smile, calm me, and draw me out of my shell when I become too introspective. She is practical and doesn’t hesitate to offer her opinion, even to play devil’s advocate in tough situations.\nJennifer was born in Barstow, California, to a military family. Her family (she has one sister) moved quite a bit, living for a time in Hawaii, Idaho, Texas, and Tennessee. After settling back in Alabama in the early 1970s, her parents both worked as educators: her mother was an administrator in the nursing department and her father was a professor of secondary education. Jennifer earned a B.S. in Nursing from the University of North Alabama and worked for about 15 years as a registered nurse.\nJennifer has, amazingly, known her husband since she was 12 years old (their mothers worked together). They have been married for 20 years and are raising cats, chickens, and four teenagers – two boys and two girls. They cultivate a wonderful garden and, ironically, her vegetarian husband raises grass-fed cattle. Jennifer homeschooled her children for many years—a responsibility that she only recently relinquished. She hadn’t really planned to work and laughingly says that she was gearing up for her first vacation in years. She says that – most days – she is glad that she didn’t take that vacation. I can safely say that we at Alabama Chanin are certainly glad that she chose to spend her time with us instead. Smile.\nJennifer says that raising her children and staying present in her marriage has been the biggest learning experience of her life; she believes that surrounding yourself with an honest support system keeps you realistic and honest with yourself. I couldn’t agree more. When asked her approach to work and life she says, “I am really just kind of winging it.” My response to that can only be: this woman has great instincts.\nJennifer Rausch, part of the heart and soul of Alabama Chanin.\nJenny was one of my best best friends from 8th grade through high school. Love love love her. Think of her often!!! So glad I read this! Hey Jenny Wilson! Miss you!! Natalie…..love keeping up with you on Twitter/FB. My husband’s aunt in Minnesota follows you and not because of me. She asked me if I know you!!!! She loves your stuff! Y’all both make me proud!\nI thoroughly enjoyed your store and deli. I agree, Jennifer makes you feel warm and welcomed in your factory.\nAlso, the young girls did too.\nI will return and bring others with me.\nI enjoyed meeting you recently at the home of Lisa Adkins. My group of friends and travel companions is planning a visit to Alabama Chanin for lunch soon. I look forward to seeing you again. I had dinner last night with Lisa and about twenty guests.\nJennifer Rausch is one of the nicest, most genuine people I know. Your article is beautifully written. She deserves the limelight.\nAnd, I might add, you are my favorite clothing designer.\nThank you for these comments on our Jenn. She always welcomes and attends every need. We love the cafe at The Factory.", "url": "https://journal.alabamachanin.com/2014/02/heart-jennifer-rausch/"}

{"text": "Alexandrists\n\nThe Alexandrists were a school of Renaissance philosophers who, in the great controversy on the subject of personal immortality, adopted the explanation of the De Anima given by Alexander of Aphrodisias.\n\nAccording to the orthodox Thomism of the Catholic Church, Aristotle rightly regarded reason as a facility of the individual soul. Against this, the Averroists, led by Agostino Nifo, introduced the modifying theory that universal reason in a sense individualizes itself in each soul and then absorbs the active reason into itself again.  These two theories respectively evolved the doctrine of individual and universal immortality, or the absorption of the individual into the eternal One.\n\nThe Alexandrists, led by Pietro Pomponazzi, assailed these beliefs and denied that either was rightly attributed to Aristotle.  They held that Aristotle considered the soul as a material and therefore a mortal entity which operates during life only under the authority of universal reason.  Hence the Alexandrists denied that Aristotle viewed the soul as immortal, because in their view, since they believed that Aristotle viewed the soul as organically connected with the body, the dissolution of the latter involves the extinction of the former.\n\nReferences \n\nAttribution:\n \n\nChristian philosophers", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandrists"}

{"text": "Leaving a Big Impression: The Renoir Family Inheritance\n\nJean Renoir did not always treasure his father’s paintings; early on, he may have principally appreciated them for the money he made selling them to fund his films. Yet, eventually, after moving to Los Angeles, he spoke of Pierre-Auguste Renoir as the central influence of his life, which he elaborated on in the genial memoir “Renoir, My Father.”\nThe place of one Renoir in the career of the other is the subject of “Renoir: Father and Son/Painting and Cinema,” a terrific, heartfelt exhibition now on view here at the Barnes Foundation. Though the show seriously considers the interplay of media, this is largely an exhibition about Jean Renoir, and about cinema. There are just 16 works by Pierre-Auguste Renoir; the museum’s own 181 Renoir paintings remain on their traditional yellow walls, according to the terms of the will of Albert C. Barnes, the foundation’s founder. The galleries are filled instead with projected clips from “A Day in the Country,” “The Diary of a Chambermaid” and more than a dozen other films by the younger Renoir, as well as stills, posters, correspondence and costumes. (The show was curated by Sylvie Patry, a deputy director at the Musée d’Orsay in Paris and a veteran of the Barnes. It travels to the Orsay in November.)\nAs a boy, Jean Renoir did not have a close relationship with his father. As in many bourgeois households in fin-de-siècle France, Jean’s mother and the domestic staff looked after him and his two siblings, while his father was largely out of sight. Pierre-Auguste Renoir was known not as “Papa” but as “Patron,” or “the boss” — the same nickname Rivette and other New Wave directors would later apply to his son.\nThe boy’s most consistent contact with his father would have occurred while he was posing for him, and there are half a dozen paintings of young Jean in this exhibition. In a portrait from 1903, the 9-year-old son appears with a jaunty red foulard tied about his neck; as is so often true of Renoirs, the oil paint looks like pastel, and Jean’s hair has the delicacy of spun silk. (In the same gallery, we see the 60-something Jean Renoir posing with that childhood portrait for a feature in the magazine Paris Match.)", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/30/arts/design/renoir-father-and-son-painting-and-cinema-review-barnes-foundation.html"}

{"text": "China Denies Using LinkedIn to Recruit German Informants\n\nPhoto\nBEIJING — China rejected on Monday accusations that it had used LinkedIn and other social media sites to infiltrate the German government, responding to claims from German intelligence services that more than 10,000 citizens had been targeted by Chinese spies.\nIn a scathing investigation released on Sunday, Germany’s domestic intelligence agency, the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, accused Beijing of using social media to connect with lawmakers and other government employees. To win their trust, the agency said, Chinese agents posed as leaders of think tanks and headhunters, and offered all-expenses-paid trips to China and meetings with influential clients.\nIn Beijing on Monday, Lu Kang, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, called the investigation “complete hearsay and groundless.” He urged German officials to “speak and act more responsibly.”\nThe German investigation added to anxieties in Western countries about Chinese efforts to infiltrate foreign governments and businesses, in an attempt to gain a competitive advantage, especially on economic and foreign policy issues. The United States has accused China of rampant economic espionage. Australia is debating tougher laws to guard against foreign interference, amid reports that China is meddling in Australian universities and elections.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nGerman officials said that Chinese agents created fake profiles in hopes of “gleaning information and recruiting sources” in Germany.

As you can see in the following image, it has five completely useless keys at the top of the keyboard. I want to remap such keys to useful things.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/O1xli.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>In this laptop, I have to use <code>Fn+F5</code> and <code>Fn+F6</code> to change the brightness, and <code>Fn+F10</code>, <code>Fn+F11</code> and <code>Fn+F12</code> to mute or change the volume. These actions are VERY cumbersome, as they need two hands to be pressed and I need to look at the keyboard to find where is the correct key. What I want is to remap the useless keys at the top (as seen in the previous picture) to change brightness and volume.</p>\n\n<p>As I said, I need a solution for Windows 7 (I've already remapped the keys on my Linux system).</p>\n\n<p>I have installed a program from Asus called <code>ATK Hotkey</code>, which is responsible for showing OSD messages about brightness/volume changes. However, this program is very bad, as it runs completely hidden from the user and has NO configuration at all. Not even configuration files, it has just a few EXE and DLL files, nothing more. It is so bad that the \"open browser\" key on my keyboard always launch Internet Explorer, even if it is not my default browser. If needed, I will happily uninstall this program if I find something better. (remapping keys to useful actions is much more important than OSD messages)</p>\n\n<h2>Things I've already tried</h2>\n\n<h3>Uninstalling ATK Hotkey</h3>\n\n<p>Without <code>ATK Hotkey</code>, I can still change the brightness (as it is probably handled by BIOS), but <code>Fn+F*</code> keys don't change the volume anymore.</p>\n\n<h3>SharpKeys 3.0</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.randyrants.com/2008/12/sharpkeys_30.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SharpKeys 3.0</a> couldn't read any of the special keys on my laptop. My bet is that they aren't actual key presses, but instead ACPI events. Thus, I need a way to map some ACPI events to useful actions.</p>\n\n<h3>AutoHotkey</h3>\n\n<p>I've tried installing <a href=\"http://www.autohotkey.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">AutoHotkey</a> and running a <a href=\"http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=302923\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">script to find scancode of a key</a>. No luck, these special keys on my laptop don't appear to generate scancode or keypress events. (got this idea from <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1391253/intercept-media-keys-on-asus-laptop/1561636#1561636\">a StackOverflow answer</a>, too bad it didn't work for me)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Update, 4 years later</em>: In 2014, that notebook broke and I stopped using it. In addition, I don't run Windows on my current notebook.</p>\n\n<p>From the <a href=\"http://forum.notebookreview.com/asus/122632-asus-info-booth-read-before-posting.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The ASUS Info Booth topic (at Notebook Review forum)</a>, I found a link called <em>Customize ASUS hotkeys</em>. That link sent me to <a href=\"http://forum.notebookreview.com/asus/150016-asus-notebook-keys-v1-3-a.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Asus notebook keys, v1.3</a> topic on that forum:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Asus notebook keys, v1.3</p>\n  \n  <p>This program gives you ability to define own actions for additional buttons of Asus notebooks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That's all I needed! What's more: the source-code is included! (too bad I don't have Visual Studio).</p>\n\n<p>However, the program from the first post has a silly GUI mistake, which was later fixed by another user and then released as <a href=\"http://forum.notebookreview.com/posts/3626811/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">AsusNbKeysCtr-1.3fix.zip</a> (but without source-code).</p>\n\n<p>Using that program (the fixed version), I was able to remap the extra laptop keys to <kbd>Volume Up</kbd>, <kbd>Volume Down</kbd> and <kbd>Volume Mute</kbd> keystrokes, which are directly recognized by Windows. That's great, and <strong>solves half of my problem</strong>!</p>\n\n<p>The other half, however, involves changing the monitor brightness. Unfortunately, there is no easy solution for that, and <strong>I need a command-line program to increase and decrease the brightness</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>I've found two command-line applications that allow me to set the brightness to some value, but they do not allow me to increase or decrease it. The first one is <a href=\"https://superuser.com/questions/219859/is-there-a-quick-way-to-change-monitor-brightness-at-night-on-windows-7-or-linu/219942#219942\">Brightener, written by Ciaran user</a>.

{"text": "With its attention to horror, human drama and, most importantly, craft, Robert Kirkman's comic book The Walking Dead harkens to the brilliance of George Romero's locally produced 1968 classic, Night of the Living Dead. Like people who presumed that story to be just another monster movie, those who presume this book to be just another spinning of the zombie yarn will be shocked. Yes, it has the required corpses walking the earth looking for human flesh, while the living, free of law and order, find themselves trapped by the age-old survival dilemma: helping myself or helping the group. Death is shockingly portrayed. But unlike so many zombie stories since Romero's classic, The Walking Dead, whose fourth installment will be released Nov. 18, achieves something greater than its genre.\nKirkman's tale is a story with characters -- not zombie fodder. Tony Moore and Charlie Adlard (both nominated for 2005 Will Eisner Awards for their work on this series) tell the tale expertly. Working in black-and-white, Moore and Adlard, create intimate emotional detail and sweeping illustrations of the scope of the zombie problem.\nThe Walking Dead succeeds because Kirkman does what Romero has perhaps been restricted from doing in the medium of cinema -- he can weave the complexity of his characters across what cinematically would be an almost impossible time scale. Romero tells separate stories across sequels; Kirkman is crafting one. Basically, The Walking Dead has what the Living Dead films cannot -- character-driven momentum. In other hands it would descend into soap opera, but with Kirkman (acclaimed writer of Invincible) the book will continue to enthrall both the seasoned, and those of us just now rediscovering the zombie genre.\nI know some of you believe I'm missing the whole point of zombie stories, and I can hear you saying, \"It's not about character. It's about ZOMBIES! Flesh-eating corpses wandering the world, trying to feast on humanity's last survivors! Gross-out shock and spectacle!\" Don't fret. Try zombies that freeze to the ground in winter, zombies led like familiars by a sword-wielding mystery girl, and panel-busting showdowns. It's just that Kirkman's character-driven story welcomes a larger audience.\nYet, accomplished as it is, The Walking Dead lacks the sardonic social commentary that George Romero is so skilled at crafting into zombie stories. Romero's latest, Land of the Dead (released on DVD Oct. 18), contains compelling social commentary equaling that of his 1968 classic.\nFinally realizing a minor theme in all of his zombie films, Romero makes the zombies deserving of our sympathy. He creates compassion to the degree that we feel sorry for these reflections of ourselves. They wander deserted streets in small towns, get strung up in bags for target practice, and chained up for photo sessions with tourist tormentors. Continuing his commentary on American society, from the nuclear family to racism, consumerism and militarization, Romero now damns imperialism from the view of the subjugated, the walking dead.\nYes, the plot is driven by the social commentary, and the characters become little more than gears moving things forward. But the machine works. It works because of a story which pulls the audience's sympathies between the zombies and the human race struggling to hold onto Pittsburgh, because of casting that includes John Leguizamo and Dennis Hopper, because of fast pacing, solid effects and of course, because of references to many things Pittsburgh (including a Land of Make Believe-like Punch and Judy show performed in the shell of a TV set). It works so well that Land of the Dead becomes Romero's best sequel, perhaps once again altering the genre.\nSo -- unless you're dying to see local filmmaker Tony Buba as a marauding biker wearing a sombrero in the Monroeville Mall -- skip Dawn or the Dead (and definitely Day of the Dead) and go right from Night of the Living Dead to Land of the Dead. The closing shots of Night of the Living Dead and the opening title sequences of Land of the Dead are eerily similar.", "url": "https://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/dead-again/Content?oid=1337671"}

{"text": "Are you thinking about using online assignment help platforms? If you answered yes, then you are definitely not alone. This service is increasing in popularity across the globe. It makes it easier for students to handle their school requirements. But the nature of the service remains shrouded in controversy. After all, teachers and professors give out assignments for a reason. They are meant to boost the skills of students both inside and outside the classroom. This begs the question: Do assignment help services benefit or hurt students?\nIt’s easy to see the benefits of hiring assignments experts to aid in your academic pursuits. They solve the problem of insufficient time to do homework’s, especially if you take on multiple part-time jobs after school hours. As you know, writing essays or completing complicated assignments can take up a boatload of time. Between gathering information and adding the final touches, your assignment can take several hours to finish.\nThe speed with which you can finish your assignments with the help of service providers like the guys at Do My Assignments is another huge benefit. Most companies accept expedited requests for an extra fee. It’s possible to get your paper or assignment in as little as 24 hours. While these aforementioned benefits are surely hard to resist, it’s worth noting that using assignment writing services offers more than meets the eye.\nAt first, it might not appear to make sense that hiring assignment help providers can improve your research skills. You don’t even need to research about anything. They will do everything for you, and this is where you can get tips from the experts.\nBy looking at the final output of the assignment expert, you could see how much it differs from the homework’s you have done yourself. It shouldn’t come as a surprise if these differences are very noticeable. You could tell that time and effort has been dedicated to producing such a well-researched assignment. Even the references and links can help you with your future requirements, as you would see how much more credible your work will look like if the links aren’t limited to Wikipedia.\nThe same applies to your presentation skills. The way the essay, research paper, or assignment is formatted can give you ideas on how to better structure your content. Notice how the ideas flow smoothly throughout, allowing you to get the point across even without the use of fancy words. You probably have a “go-to” format for your essays, but you’ll realize that it doesn’t always work.\nIt’s easy to dismiss assignment writing services as only for lazy students who do not care at all about learning. But it’s important to understand that the students can enjoy much more than its time-saving benefits. With the help of experts, you can pick up some tips on how to research about a topic, what credible sources to use, and how to present your ideas in a way that engages readers. All of these can prove beneficial for any student, even the ones who do remarkably well in class.", "url": "http://oddculture.com/assignment-help-services-benefit-students/"}

{"text": "Challenging times for Noah who has Hirschsprung’s disease\n\nA Preston mum admits she is still learning about her son’s rare condition, which affects one in 5,000 children.\nThree-year-old Noah Walton, of Broughton, showed no signs of being ill when he was a baby, but when he was losing weight, his parents, Janet Kidd and Alan Walton, took him to Royal Preston Hospital.\nNoah Walton, of Broughton, at 12 days old at Alder Hey Children's Hospital\nAfter the third visit the three-month-old began vomiting green bile and was transferred to Alder Hey Children’s Hospital, where he was diagnosed with Hirschsprung’s disease, a condition that affects the large intestine (colon) and causes problems with passing stool.\nJanet, 43, says: “Noah showed no signs of being ill and was happy feeding. But there was something grumbling away as he was losing weight.\n“We went to Royal Preston Hospital twice for him to be checked over and everything seemed to be okay until the third time as it was obvious something was not right.\n“He was vomiting green bile after a few hours and we were rushed in an ambulance to Alder Hey.\nNoah Walton, of Broughton, at 12 days old at Alder Hey Children's Hospital\n“He had a barium x-ray, where he had dye going through a tube through his nose to his intestines to see where the blockage was.\n“Doctors couldn’t find anything, so they had to check the other end and that was when they found a blockage in his large intestine and bowel.\n“Noah then had to have a bowel wash out using syringe tubes and saline solution until he became better and had put on weight, ready for surgery.\n“It was a very upsetting time when he was in neonatal with tubes everywhere.”\nNoah Walton, of Broughton, at three months old at Alder Hey Children's Hospital after his surgery. Pictures with his dad Alan Walton\nNoah was in Alder Hey for three months until he was deemed fit for surgery and he had 10cm of his bowel removed via the ‘pull through’ method.\nJanet adds: “After that, Noah was able to poo normally, however he does face periods of incontinence, especially when he gets a cold, an ear infection, sickness or diarrhoea.\n“These bugs affect Noah in a big way and it can take two weeks to a month to get over. He can go through bouts of having a runny nose, having a high temperature, vomiting and diarrhoea.\n“He takes medication so his stool is soft and he can pass it normally. He is always thirsty as he had the part of his bowel removed which absorbs water.\nNoah Walton, of Broughton, at three months old at Alder Hey Children's Hospital after his surgery\n“A bad day can be when we have to change Noah 16 times and put him in a pull up nappy.\n“I am still learning about it all myself. This condition affects one in 5,000 children and I don’t know anyone else in the area. I have come across one or two in other areas.\n“If anyone else is out there, I would be happy to speak to them.\n“I went to a group arranged through Alder Hey and met a few affected children. It was then I realised how lucky Noah was as some children have had larger segments of their bowel removed and they need stoma bags. It was a real eye opener.”\nJanet is now fund-raising for Alder Hey Children’s Hospital as a thank you for the support and treatment Noah received.\nShe adds: “We spent a lot of time there. We go every three months and he will continue under their care until he is 18. It is so important for us and Noah to say thank you.”\n•Hirschsprung’s disease is a rare condition that causes poo to become stuck in the bowels. It mainly affects babies and young children.\nIt can cause severe constipation, and occasionally lead to a serious bowel infection called enterocolitis if it’s not identified and treated early on.\nSymptoms of Hirschsprung’s disease in a baby include failing to pass meconium (dark, tar-like poo that healthy babies pass soon after being born) within 48 hours; a swollen belly and vomiting green fluid.\nSigns in older infants and children include a swollen belly and a tummy ache; persistent constipation; not feeding well or not gaining much weight.", "url": "https://www.lep.co.uk/news/challenging-times-for-noah-who-has-hirschsprung-s-disease-1-8904260"}

{"text": "Already a runaway bestseller in the author’s native Germany, The Hidden Life of Trees now offers English-language readers a compelling look at the “secret world” of the forest. Peter Wohlleben, a forester, documents his conversion from lumber producer to tree whisperer, and in the process he reveals the highly communicative social networks of trees.\nWohlleben notes that as humans, we have been more inclined to identify with animals than plants: We recognize a kinship across species when we notice that monkeys indulge in social grooming rituals, or that elephants mourn their dead. Using the language of anthropomorphism, Wohlleben seeks to persuade us that trees too are social beings, in constant communication with one another, caring for their sick and nursing their young. He wants us to recognize our kinship with trees so we’ll be encouraged to preserve their ecosystems more readily.\nTrees “speak” to one another through scent, as African acacia trees do when giraffes begin feeding off of them. The acacias being eaten send out a warning scent, which alerts other nearby acacias to produce the bitter toxin that will dissuade the giraffes from eating their leaves. Trees also communicate through a vast fungal network twined around their roots, which transmit electrical signals and chemical compounds. Through this “Wood Wide Web,” forests are truly an interconnected ecosystem—as Wohlleben demonstrates, trees in a community will send healing sugars to the roots of weak or ill trees, and some forests will keep the stumps of their elders alive long after their trunks and branches have disintegrated.\nIn part, Wohlleben wants to demonstrate how centuries of forestry have harmed trees, especially the practice of thinning out trees, which keeps them from establishing healthy underground communication lines. But even more, he wants to enchant readers into taking a walk in the woods and listening to the trees themselves.", "url": "https://blog.booksamillion.com/top-picks/bookpage/2016/09/book-day-hidden-life-trees-peter-wohlleben/"}

{"text": "Oregon Duck fans – and Pac-12 fans, for that matter – are sick and tired of hearing about how great the Southeastern Conference (SEC) is. Broadcasters constantly speak about how the SEC is ahead of the Pac-12 in recruiting, quality of play and revenue. Well, that no longer appears to be the case.\nThe absence of an SEC team in the 2015 NCAA Football National Championship Game is one reason to believe there’s change coming. However, it may surprise you to know that the Pac-12 made more money than the SEC and the B1G in terms of total revenue during the 2013-14 fiscal year (FY14), according to Steve Berkowitz of USA TODAY Sports.\nThe Pac-12’s revenue nearly doubled from FY13’s $175 million to $334 million in FY14. Berkowitz also reported that Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott remained the nation’s most highly-paid conference CEO, earning just over $3.5 million in total compensation for the 2013 calendar year.\nHere’s a breakdown of the Pac-12’s total revenues for FY14: Bowl games $41.6 million, NCAA championships $26.3 million, television and media rights $252.7 million, advertising $9 million, investments totaling around $4.2 million – for a grand total of $333,992,599.\nFor now, the Pac-12 leads all other conferences in revenue. That may change in a few years, due to the SEC’s launch of its own television network with ESPN. However, it’s safe to say that the Pac-12 isn’t content with playing second fiddle to other conferences anymore.", "url": "https://fishduck.com/2015/05/the-pac-12-makes-more-money-than-the-sec-bank-it/"}

{"text": "Goodbye: Pioneering AOL Instant Messenger to be discontinued\n\n(AP) – AOL announced Friday that it is discontinuing its pioneering Instant Messenger chat platform after 20 years of service.\nAn article on AOL’s website posted Friday says AOL Instant Messenger will be discontinued on Dec. 15. In a blog post , a spokesman for AOL’s parent company explained the platform’s demise as the casualty of the evolving way people communicate.\n“AIM tapped into new digital technologies and ignited a cultural shift, but the way in which we communicate with each other has profoundly changed,” wrote Michael Albers, vice president of communications at Oath.\nThe program will still function until Dec. 15 After that date, users won’t be able to sign in and all data will be deleted. AOL says people with an aim.com email address will still be able to use it.\nLaunched in 1997, AOL Instant Messenger was at the forefront of what was called at the time the biggest trend in online communication since email.\nThe platform, which provided instant access to friends and contacts on a user’s “buddy list,” was wildly popular for the first few years after its launch. It claimed more than 100 million registered users in 2001.\nAOL was fiercely protective of its dominance in the instant messaging market. It fended off rivals, including Microsoft, by blocking their messaging platforms from communicating with AOL users.

{"text": "Hundreds of Burmese migrant workers are queuing up in Mae Sot for passports and visas with a June 14 deadline approaching.\nThe sun has already set on a rundown apartment building down a quiet narrow alley near the Mae Sot-Myawaddy border. A large group of Burmese migrant workers congregate outside.\nThey have been waiting for the Thai agency to process their visas since the early afternoon. They already spent hours queuing up, in the hot summer sun, on the Friendship Bridge to get day passes to enter Thailand. The agency charged them 400 baht (US $12.70) for the pass, even though it officially only costs 20 baht.\nThe agency is just one of dozens which have sprung up along the border in recent months, cashing on the looming June 14 deadline for National Verification. The new Thai law requires foreign workers from Burma, Cambodia and Laos to be legally registered to work in the country.\nAnswering the call of a Thai labor crisis, thousands of Burmese workers cross into Mae Sot every day, hoping to earn a salary several times higher than in their native Burma.\nAlong the highway leading to the Friendship Bridge, larger crowds of migrant workers wait outside other agencies. With bags in toe, scores of mini-buses wait to transport them to Bangkok and with them their dreams of making money. The scene is reminiscent of a gold rush. However in this scenario, where migrant workers can expect to pay 10 times the official fee (500 baht) for a one-year visa, it’s obvious who the prospectors are and who is getting mined.\nSeveral years ago, the Thai government announced that all foreign workers must be registered or risk deportation. The deadline was extended several times after rights groups complained about the impracticalities of registering millions of migrant workers throughout the country.\nThere are an estimated 2-3 million Burmese migrant workers in Thailand, making up about 5 percent of the total Thai work force.\nThe annual remittance from Burmese nationals working overseas is more than $3.6 billion, Burma’s Deputy Labour Minister Myint Thein told Thai press in April, following a meeting with Thai ministers to iron out the details for the implementation of the National Verification process, according to a Bangkok Post article.\nIronically, he praised the significant contributions Burmese migrant workers had made to the country’s economic growth.\nSome people wonder if the real reason Naypyidaw is supporting the National Verification process is to collect taxes from the millions of Burmese working abroad.\nOthers, from ethnic areas where corruption by local authorities is still rampant, worry that the personal information they are required to provide to get a passport will be exploited to extort money from relatives back home.\nSam Win is from Karen state. He used to work on a garbage truck in Bangkok, earning 150 baht ($4.77) a day. When heavy flooding ravaged Thailand’s largest city causing a mass exodus of migrant workers, he had to leave without collecting his salary.\nUnfortunately, Sam Win was one of the thousands of migrant workers who got caught in a Thai police net on the way back to the border.\nImmigration officers delivered him to the Border Guard Force on the Thai side of the Myawaddy River, where he had to pay a 2,500-baht ($80) bribe or risk being sold to human traffickers.\nNearly one year later, Sam Win finds himself sitting on a curb in Mae Sot, waiting three days for an agency to process his Thai visa. He is only a five-minute drive, by detention center truck, from the spot where the Thai police deported him.\nThe Thai visa and Burmese passport cost him 10,000 baht, money he had to borrow to pay. Although Sam Win doesn’t have a confirmed job in Bangkok, he hopes to return to his municipal employment.\nBefore coming back to Thailand, he tried to make money in his village farming, but gave up because the earnings were too low.\nHis relative, Tin Aung, who is also waiting for a Thai visa, does not have a job either. But he still paid 16,000 baht (over $500) for his Burmese passport and Thai visa because he was in a hurry.\nFor the last eight years, Tin Aung worked on boats in Pattaya. Last month, with the National Verification deadline approaching, he decided to return to Burma to get his passport.\n“I didn’t want to pay the human smugglers to travel back home so I turned myself in to Thai immigration, who deported me to the border,” said Tin Aung.\nNow a month later, he is anxious to return to bangkok where his wife and daughter are waiting. Tin Aung couldn’t afford to pay for their documents, which means after June 14, only he will able to legal in the family.\nDespite all the money he had to borrow to obtain his visa and passport, Tin Aung says he is “happy” to finally have legal status in Thailand.\n“The last time I worked here, I was always felt afraid of the police. Now I can go wherever I want. For the first time [in Thailand] I feel freedom,” said Tin Aung.", "url": "https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/june-deadline-spurs-migrant-visa-rush.html"}

{"text": "Between 1993 and 2013, 108 serious pipeline incidents caused $44 million in damages.\nDominion Resources has been promoting belief in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline proposal. But this proposal isn't about belief. It's about construction of a new 550-mile, high-pressure, 42-inch natural gas pipeline with a projected transmission capacity of 1.5 billion cubic feet of volatile gas every day. Sections of this line could be routed through some rugged, remote, unstable or unsuitable terrain in Augusta County.\nThinking that this pipeline would be benign and immune from corrosion, rupture, explosions, or toxic-contaminant leaks throughout its lifetime is uninformed. In 2012, 20-inch transmission gas pipeline melted guardrails and blew a hole in I-77 in Sissonville, W. Va. It burned so hot that siding melted on the houses hundreds of feet away. Between 1993 and 2013, the Pipeline Hazardous Materials Safety Administration reports 108 \"serious\" incidents for natural gas transmission pipelines and their more than 80 explosions and fires in 2012 alone, which caused $44 million in damages. Pictures of these huge pipelines can be viewed online at \"Gas Transmission Pipeline Images.\"\nDominion has no actual experience with a pipeline this huge. But would its blend of three major ACP business partners muddy construction communications, accountability and oversight? The funny classic, \"Who's on first?\" wouldn't be funny.\nDominion claims that the Augusta County would receive $1.5 million in annual tax revenues. But Dominion's spokesman stated at Lee High that Dominion would not put up a bond for contingencies. Does this mean that emergency costs would shift to the local community? If so, how much might they be? These costs would be deducted from the $1.5 million.\nThe fossil fuel industry, including Dominion Resources, has received a century of taxpayer subsidies. If taxpayer costs for climate change, military expeditions for fossil fuels, pollution and its related public-health costs were actually included, some estimates of these subsidies are one trillion dollars annually. These further reduce the $1.5 million.\nDominion has been blocking solar power net-metering and other efforts to offer more affordable, sustainable energy choices to Virginians. This obstructionism comes with its hefty price, too.\n\"It's time for thinking people to think.\" This proposal isn't about belief.", "url": "https://www.newsleader.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/01/05/dominions-pipeline-high-price/21283075/"}

{"text": "I apologize for waiting so long to reply. There were two reasons for my delay: ignorance and discouragement. My ignorance was of Lonergan's economics; my discouragement was from the feeling I had that my posts to the forum were functioning as conversation-killers. I had the impression, correct or incorrect, that other members of the forum no longer wanted to converse with me. I am again posting to the forum because conversations on the Lonergan_l list serve have brought up the prospect of creating a blog that would, it seems to me, duplicate what has been created here. So I have decided to participate again in what I regard as a well-constructed site, potentially a great setting for the kinds of conversations for which I hope.\nPolanyi, like Lonergan, believed that economic reform depended upon better economic education, and struggled to make Keynes' thinking accessible to the general public. One of his efforts involved creating an animated movie as a teaching device, hence the title of the essay that was the focus of several critical essays in that issue of Tradition and Discovery, \"The Visual Presentation of Social Matters.\" Through animation, Polanyi hoped to be able to present a model of the economic that was dynamic, rather than static, as is the case in non-animated pictures.\nI am currently involved in reading volumes 21 and 15 of the Collected Works, and in reading some things others have written about Lonergan's economics. I expect to post some more of my reflections in this in this location.", "url": "https://www.lonerganforum.com/index.php?topic=923.0;prev_next=next"}

{"text": "'Call of Duty' goes back to what it does best: historic warfare\n\nHere at E3, Activision and Sledgehammer are showing off the campaign in a cinematic setting while letting us put our fingers on the trigger in multiplayer. I got a look at Team Deathmatch, Domination and War Mode in my brief time with Call of Duty: WWII. Antique weapons, trench warfare and close quarters combat make the team play here very fun. There are a ton of blind corners and places to hide, so you can walk right past an opposing player without knowing it until it's too late. It happened to me a lot.\nAs far as the campaign is concerned, the story focuses on Private \"Red\" Daniels as he fights for the Allied Powers in Europe during 1944 and 1945. Yes, that includes the beaches of Normandy and D-Day. Some key aspects of the campaign mode include using health packs (first-aid kits) to heal yourself and relying heavily on the members of your squad to complete objectives and avoid dying on the battlefield. As you might expect with Call of Duty, there's plenty of violence and gore and the gameplay I saw included multiple gruesome decapitations.\nDivisions also play a big role here, as you can select which job you want to have during each match. Of course, each one comes with its own weapons, uniforms and responsibilities. There's also a headquarters in the game where you can do all of those training exercises, including one-on-one combat. Unfortunately, Sledgehammer wasn't showing off that Nazi zombies mode, but we already knew it would be part of the game.\nI'll have to reserve any definitive judgment on Call of Duty: WWII until I'm able to play through the campaign and spend more time getting owned in multiplayer. Thankfully, I won't have to wait too long to do that. Sledgehammer says a private beta will be available this summer and the full game is set to launch November 3rd on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One -- just in time to offer some respite from your holiday madness. Going back in time could bring fans back to the series, it's just too early to tell how compelling a case Activision and Sledgehammer will make.\nFollow all the latest news from E3 2017 here!", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/2017/06/14/call-of-duty-wwii-historic-warfare/"}

{"text": "Henrique scores twice, Ducks end Bruins' streak with 3-1 win\n\nBOSTON (AP) — Adam Henrique scored twice and the Anaheim Ducks ended Boston's 18-game point streak with a 3-1 victory over the Bruins on Tuesday night.\nJakob Silfverberg also scored for the Ducks, the first team to beat the Bruins in regulation since Washington's 5-3 win Dec. 14 at Boston. Cam Fowler and Rickard Rakell had two assists apiece.\nJohn Gibson made 25 saves before leaving in the third period with an undisclosed injury. Ryan Miller played the final 7:25 and nearly completed a shutout for the Ducks before Ryan Spooner scored for Boston with 41 seconds left.\nHenrique scored into an empty net with 6.1 seconds remaining to seal it for the Ducks, who halted Boston's five-game winning streak and a stretch of 18 games with at least one point (14-0-4), which tied for the second-longest in franchise history.\nAnton Khudobin stopped 24 shots for the Bruins, who never recovered after being outshot 15-5 in the first period and falling behind 2-0 on goals by Silfverberg and Henrique.\nThe Ducks have won eight straight against the Bruins, who haven't beaten Anaheim since a 3-2 shootout win on Oct. 21, 2013.\nAnaheim took a 1-0 lead when Khudobin couldn't quite hang onto a long backhand by Fowler. The puck fell from Khudobin's glove and slid across the crease, where it appeared to be knocked in by Bruins captain Zdeno Chara as he went crashing into his own net 9:04 into the game. Silfverberg was credited with the goal and assists went to Fowler and Rakell, who set up the Ducks' second goal a few minutes later when Henrique scored.\nThe Ducks were on a power play and worked the puck around the corners, then to Henrique in the right circle for a wrist shot that beat Khudobin on the stick side at 13:59.\nGibson needed a few minutes to regroup after a hard shot from Patrice Bergeron hit him in the ribs early in the third, then ended up leaving with 7:25 left and was replaced by Miller.\nNOTES: The Ducks opened a five-game road trip against Atlantic Division teams. ... Boston LW Anders Bjork left after the first period with an upper-body injury. ... Boston was without leading scorer Brad Marchand, who sat out the second of a five-game suspension for throwing an elbow last week against New Jersey.\nUP NEXT\nDucks: Visit the Ottawa Senators on Thursday night.\nBruins: Host the St. Louis Blues on Thursday night.\n___\nMore AP hockey: https://apnews.com/tag/NHLhockey", "url": "https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3354618"}

{"text": "Detroit Lions WR Bruce Ellington (hamstring) did not participate in practice Friday, Dec. 14, and has been ruled out for Week 15.\nHuddle Up: T.J. Jones, Andy Jones and Theo Riddick could all see some more targets with Ellington out of the lineup. Riddick can be a flex option in all leagues but will be more valuable in point-per-reception leagues. Kenny Golladay is probably the only Lions receiver that should be started in fantasy leagues.\nDetroit Lions WR Bruce Ellington (hamstring) did not participate in practice for the second straight day Thursday, Dec. 13.\nHuddle Up: Ellington has become heavily involved in Detroit's offense in recent weeks, totaling 23 catches in the last four games. However, it seems more likely he won't be able to suit up Sunday. Kenny Golladay would benefit in that case but he's the only player worth deploying from what has been an inconsistent unit in 2018.\nDetroit Lions WR Bruce Ellington (back) was limited during practice Friday, Dec. 7, and is listed as questionable for Week 14.\nHuddle Up: Ellington has posted 19 receptions in three games since joining the Lions but has not posted great yardage total during that span. Ellington can be a flex option in point-per-reception leagues but probably is not a great option in standard leagues.\nDetroit Lions WRs Kenny Golladay (quadriceps) and Bruce Ellington (back) remained limited in practice Thursday, Dec. 6.\nHuddle Up: Golladay faces a double whammy this week in that he could be hampered by the quad injury and he could be shadowed by Patrick Peterson. He still has WR2 upside, but use caution. Ellington, meanwhile, is more of a PPR flex consideration after seeing 26 targets over his last three games.\nDetroit Lions WR Bruce Ellington racked up seven receptions for 35 yards on a game-high 10 targets in Week 13 against the Los Angeles Rams.\nHuddle Up: Ellington was targeted early and often in this one, and he did well on the short routes. For fantasy owners in PPR leagues, he had a fair performance, worthy of low-end WR4 consideration. He has very little use in standard play heading into Week 14 against the Arizona Cardinals, however.\nDetroit Lions WR Bruce Ellington (back) was limited during practice Thursday, Nov. 29.\nHuddle Up: Ellington has been targeted 16 times over the last two games and appears to have a solid role in the passing game. He will be facing a tough Los Angeles Rams defense this week and probably can be avoided this week because of the matchup.\nDetroit Lions WR Bruce Ellington (back) was limited in practice Wednesday, Nov. 28.\nHuddle Up: Out of nowhere, Ellington has seen 16 targets over his last two contests, catching six passes in each game. The yardage has left something to be desired, but Ellington possesses flex allure nonetheless.\nDetroit Lions WR Bruce Ellington caught six passes for 28 yards against the Chicago Bears in Week 12.\nHuddle Up: Ellington has been targeted 16 times in two games since joining the Lions and appears to be a reliable option for Matthew Stafford. Ellington could be a flex option in point-per-reception leagues since he has 12 catches in the last two games.\nDetroit Lions WR Bruce Ellington (back) was limited in practice Wednesday, Nov. 21, and he's questionable for Week 12.\nHuddle Up: He had a 6-52-0 line on nine targets last week, and Marvin Jones (knee) is out. Ellington is a sneaky flex play against the Chicago Bears if he's good to go.\nDetroit Lions WR Bruce Ellington (back) was limited in practice Tuesday, Nov. 20.\nHuddle Up: Ellington is an underrated fantasy asset heading into the Thanksgiving slate after catching six of nine targets for 52 yards last week. The nine targets are what stand out and what make Ellington a flex option in two days.\nDetroit Lions WR Bruce Ellington posted six receptions for 52 yards on nine targets in Week 11 against the Carolina Panthers.\nHuddle Up: Ellington has scooted up the pecking order for receptions since the trade of Golden Tate, as well as the injury to Marvin Jones. If you're desperate for a WR4 in PPR fantasy leagues heading into Week 12 against the Chicago Bears on Thursday, Ellington is worth a look.\nHouston Texans WR Bruce Ellington (hamstring) left with a hamstring injury in the first quarter of Week 3 game against the New York Giants on Sunday, Sept. 23, and is listed as questionable to return.\nHuddle Up: Ellington had one 10-yard catch early, and we'll see if he can get back on the field.\nHouston Texans WR Bruce Ellington posted three grabs and 45 yards in Week 2 against the Tennessee Titans.\nHuddle Up: Ellington was up as the No. 2 receiver in Week 1, but Will Fuller (hamstring) made his debut in Week 2 and Ellington's targets were limited. He is nothing more than a WR5 in leagues of 12 or more teams when Fuller and DeAndre Hopkins are healthy. The Texans host the Giants in Week 3.\nHouston Texans WR Bruce Ellington posted four receptions for 37 yards and a touchdown in the Week 1 game against the New England Patriots. He was targeted eight times.\nHuddle Up: Ellington has risen to the No. 2 receiver behind DeAndre Hopkins in the Texans offense, at least while Will Fuller is on the shelf. As long as the latter is sidelined, Ellington has some low-end WR4 or flex fantasy option in leagues of 12 or more teams. The Texans travel to meet the Titans in Week 2.", "url": "http://kffl.com/nfl/player/8803/"}

Adem�s, ha indicado que hay que \"aceptar\" que en el discurso cinematogr�fico \"va haber nuevas ventanas\".\nPor esto, De la Iglesia, que ha participado este mi�rcoles en el I Congreso Nacional de Cine Espa�ol que se celebra hasta este viernes en M�laga, ha considerado \"necesario\" que tanto las televisiones, como los productores, exhibidores, distribuidores, Gobierno y cineastas, entre otros, \"estemos unidos para discutir las cosas en com�n y la Academia de Cine es el marco perfecto\".\n\"El cine es distribuci�n, exhibici�n y promoci�n, adem�s de una pel�cula\", ha sentenciado, al tiempo que ha explicado que hay que buscar la manera \"de que las diferentes ventanas no se tapen unas a otras\", por ello, ha indicado que hay que \"encontrar el tiempo para cada una\".\nNo obstante, para el director espa�ol, una pel�cula \"existe si se exhibe en salas\", por lo que ha asegurado que \"eso no puede perderse\", ya que \"forma parte del mismo hecho cinematogr�fico\". \"El tipo de cine que se hace si se ve en una pantalla o en una de ordenador es diferente, por ello es necesario que para que el cine siga siendo cine, y no otra cosa, tiene que seguir vi�ndose en salas y eso no puede acabar nunca\", ha apostillado.\nTambi�n ha hecho referencia a la crisis, asegurando que en el sector audiovisual es \"particularmente aguda\", ya que, seg�n ha explicado, \"coincide con una autentica reconversi�n industrial\". \"Los formatos est�n cambiando y las ventanas de exhibici�n, y todo eso hace que tengamos que estar m�s unidos que nunca\". LEY\nPreguntado por los periodistas sobre hasta qu� punto una modificaci�n de la ley del cine puede ayudar a la industria para que se relance, ha incidido en que \"es absolutamente necesario\" tener una cobertura legal que permita que se desarrolle la industria \"convenientemente\", aunque eso, a su juicio, \"no va a ocurrir sino conseguimos ponernos de acuerdo entre las partes\".\nEn este sentido, ha abogado por la Academia de Cine como espacio \"perfecto\" para \"entre todos, llegar a un acuerdo y que el audiovisual se desarrolle en la medida en la que todos queremos, que es que vaya cada vez a m�s\".\nPor otro lado, tambi�n ha destacado el papel \"esencial\" de las televisiones en el sector y, a su juicio, \"deber�an ser como los antiguos estudios, deber�an ser los promotores de proyectos\", por lo que le gustar�a que \"reconocieran que ellos no solamente son productores de televisi�n sino de cine, probablemente del cine m�s exitoso que se ha hecho en los �ltimos a�os y sin ellos es muy dif�cil, ya que forman parte de la industria\".Más sobre�lex de la Iglesia\nAsimismo, ha explicado que si se quiere saber cu�l es el valor de la industria en Espa�a \"hay que preguntar fuera\", respondiendo en este caso que \"es junto a la francesa la m�s respetada de Europa, por su diversidad, porque no tenemos nada que ver unos con otros y porque se hacen pel�culas comerciales de gran �xito que llegan hasta los �scar, cosa absolutamente impensable en otras cinematograf�as\". En este sentido, ha aportado como dato que \"somos el segundo pa�s con m�s �scar del mundo\" y ha a�adido que \"es necesario encontrar ese punto de uni�n para darnos cuenta de que tenemos una industria que puede ser y debe ser rentable\".\nDe la Iglesia ha participado en el I Congreso Nacional de Cine Espa�ol, en el que un centenar de expertos reflexionan sobre esta industria, y ha asegurado que este evento \"es una de las iniciativas m�s inteligentes\" que ha visto \"en a�os\", al tiempo que lo ha considerado \"una maravilla\" y un \"complemento perfecto\" para el Festival de M�laga.Cine Espa�ol, al que ha calificado, junto con el Festival Internacional de Cine de Donostia-San Sebasti�n, como \"el m�s importante\", asegurando que es \"esencial\" para el cine espa�ol.\n\"Es absolutamente necesario reunirnos y hablar del audiovisual cuanto antes para encontrar salidas y soluciones\", ha explicado el director espa�ol.

{"text": "What we're playing: 'Tacoma,' 'Final Fantasy' and 'A Dark Room'\n\nFinal Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age\nMat Smith\nBureau Chief, UK\nMy Final Fantasy completion list (barring those pesky online ones, pschh) had one glaring omission: the (ironically rather MMORPG-styled) Final Fantasy XII. Now that it's arrived on PS4, I got another chance to strike that iteration off the list -- and as they say, third time's the charm. Yep, I first bought the game at launch for PS2, but I barely inched through it, busy wrapping up university and preparing for a move to Japan. This meant that the lengthy fantasy space opera RPGs had to wait. I already noticed that it had a different allure from other Final Fantasy titles. A few hours of playing the game had revealed interesting (for once) protagonists, mysteries to be solved, and a world that seemed big -- ready to be explored. Unfortunately, I wasn't ready.\nThe second time, I picked up the 2007 International edition for my Japanese PS2 at launch -- such enthusiasm! I got roughly halfway through, combining my nascent kanji-reading skills with English dialogue, but came unstuck by a section that involved matching NPC conversations together. I wasn't willing to let the internet do the work for me, so, again, I paused.\nIn 2017, ten years since that edition, I now got to play a more polished version that showcases the game at its best: high-resolution textures and character models that were already highly detailed back in 2006, as well as a revamped soundtrack with some live instrumentation massaged into the previously all-digital score.\nIt's the characters and the voice acting that stand the test of time. I'd argue they're better than what we got with FFXV (another divisive entry), and just so delightfully otherworldly. There are chunks of Shakespeare, elvish-nordic intonation to everything the bunnywomen Viera clanswomen say, pissed-off princesses and so much more. The phrasing, the delivery, everything works so very well -- so well that only a handful of contemporary games can match it even now.\nBattles are dealt with using the gambit system, which is a huge change from the timer gauges that I became used to on PS1 RPGs. Gambits are little programmable nuggets that tell your party members (both the one you're in control of and the rest) what to do. Weak to fire? Fire spells, please. Dead ally? Throw a phoenix down in their direction. With time (and more slots unlocked as you progress), it grows into a rich, customizable system that allows your party to fight for itself, largely, as you make tweaks for bosses and toggle your gambits to suit each situation.\nThe system allowed me to build my characters in an educated way, and cut a swath through the game. I still haven't finished it (busy month, OK?), but I've gone about 20 hours beyond my last attempt, picking off side quests and hitting up in-game distractions on the way. Once it's done, I'll be back on track with Final Fantasy. Or at least, I will after I work my way through some of that multiplayer Final Fantasy XV.\nTacoma\nDevindra Hardawar\nSenior Editor\nTacoma won me over almost immediately. The game starts off in a tiny shuttle, with an adorable AI chattering along as you dock onto the abandoned Tacoma space station. We don't know why the crew disappeared; your job is just to find the ship's AI and bring it to your employer. That's all pretty typical for a sci-fi game today -- but then you have to interact with the ship's computer. Instead of typing something onto a keyboard or touchpad, your character, Amy, inputs letters using American Sign Language (ASL). It's a small moment that takes only a few seconds, but it blew me away with its elegance.\nASL isn't something you typically see as an input method in science fiction, and yet it seems to fit perfectly. It's the sort of thoughtful touch we've come to expect from Fullbright, the studio that wowed us with Gone Home back in 2013.\nTacoma evolves the concept of exploration-driven narrative that we saw in Gone Home in some unique ways. In addition to rummaging through their rooms and offices, you can also watch augmented reality recordings of the crew, who are all represented with simplistic polygonal models. It's almost like viewing their digital ghosts. Since they typically involve several people, you'll have to get used to rewinding the AR footage and following different characters around the ship.\nThis process might sound frustrating, but I found it endlessly engrossing. It helps to humanize the crew in new ways: You can hear intimate conversations between couples, or moments of quiet desperation when the crew starts to run out of air. Those conversations also give us a glimpse at the world outside the space station, where AI is getting more powerful than ever, and workers unite to fight back against soulless corporations (what else is new, right?).\nTacoma, ultimately, is full of short, memorable moments. It could be longer, and it never quite reaches the dramatic heights of Gone Home. But it's yet another solid attempt by Fullbright at exploring the narrative potential for games.\nA Dark Room\nRob LeFebvre\nContributing Writer\nAmirali Rajan's mobile game A Dark Room begins with an homage to a common text adventure trope. You wake up in the dark with a headache and blurry vision. The room you're in is cold, and the fire is dead. The only thing you can do is light that fire. With this single tap, you're drawn into the mystery.\nA Dark Room itself is a button-tapping mashup between an idle-clicker and a text adventure. Instead of typing in commands, you tap on them: gather wood, bait traps, build huts. A wandering builder comes to your fire, offering her services to make more things, like a cart, more traps, or another hut. Each new living space brings more villagers, and you'll build up an impressive bunch of workers who will automatically gather wood, hunt and bait animal traps and (eventually) mine iron, coal and steel. You'll need to keep them all supplied with resources, which is where the crafting comes in: Supply the builder with wood, leather, fur and other basics to craft items, which in turn can be used to supply workers or craft more complicated things, like weapons and caravans.\nAs your village gets larger, you'll get to travel outside of it, encountering the post-apocalyptic wasteland represented on an ASCII character map. You'll encounter crazed survivors and immense beasts, so you'll want to carry some weapons and armor with you. Through it all, the game reveals its mystery with special text messages about the unknown builder's past and her strange reluctance to supply you with more items. The constant need to gather wood and check traps, as well as manage the village's workload and explore the world outside of my always growing town, keeps me coming back to A Dark Room again and again. While the initial loop is intriguing and fun, managing the larger sets of variables later in the game gets pretty complicated, making for much deeper gameplay than you'll typically find in a mobile title.\nFinal Fantasy XV DLC\nSean Buckley\nAssociate Editor\nI never planned on playing Final Fantasy XV. After a decade of disappointing sequels and spin-offs, I'd written the franchise off. Then a surprise Christmas gift beckoned me to revisit the franchise, and I found myself obsessed with the game's lush open world, uncharacteristically active battle system and bizarre product tie-ins. I fell in love with its characters too -- a cast of four best friends on an epic road trip to save the world. It was an experience that left me wanting more, and I spent months looking forward to DLC that promised to show me character-focused vignettes that had been left out of the main story.\nThen a terrible, wonderful thing happened: The Nintendo Switch came out. Between The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Mario Kart 8 and Arms, the new console dominated my free time. It wasn't until recently that I got back to Final Fantasy XV's two released DLC packs -- Episode Gladiolus and Prompto. I have mixed feelings.\nBoth DLC chapters fill in parts of the story that were left out of the main game. We learn why Gladiolus came back to the party with a new scar, and a little about where Prompto was in the final chapters of the story -- but neither of these characters was directly playable in the core game. It makes the DLC packs interesting, because they not only give you control over a new character, but change Final Fantasy's gameplay mechanics to better suit that character's personality. Prompto's adventure took this idea to an extreme. Not only does the short episode explain more about the photographer/gunman's extremely vague backstory, but it completely changes the style of the game from a fast-paced action RPG to a pseudo third-person shooter.\nThe new gameplay style was a fun challenge, and I loved being able to spend more time with one of my favorite characters -- but so far, Final Fantasy XV's DLC has left me wanting. It just doesn't answer enough questions, particularly when it comes to Prompto. The core game leaves gaping questions about the character, both when he leaves your party and when he returns -- and his downloadable adventure just barely answers half of them.\nI don't regret playing the Final Fantasy XV DLC. I just wish it did a little more.\n\"IRL\" is a recurring column in which the Engadget staff run down what they're buying, using, playing and streaming.", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/2017/08/14/what-were-playing-tacoma-final-fantasy-and-a-dark-room/"}

{"text": "Philly congressman Brady won't seek another term\n\nU.S. Rep. Bob Brady of Philadelphia will not seek another term in Congress, giving up the seat he's held for two decades, his office said Wednesday.\nBrady revealed the news to reporters and Democratic Party ward leaders in Philadelphia, his hometown and the city where he has been the longtime Democratic Party leader.\nBrady, 72, was facing a potentially stiff primary challenge from a former city official, Nina Ahmad, as his district faced near-certain changes now that a gerrymandering lawsuit has prompted the state Supreme Court to order a redrawing of the boundaries of Pennsylvania's 18 congressional districts. The decision is on appeal by top state Republican lawmakers at the U.S. Supreme Court.\nBrady's district is heavily Democratic, and will likely remain in Democratic hands.\nBrady's retirement means there are six open seats in Pennsylvania, the most in decades. Four Republican congressmen have announced that they would not seek re-election — one, Lou Barletta, is running for U.S. Senate — while another Republican congressman, Tim Murphy, resigned in a scandal last fall.\nBrady's decision comes after the FBI investigated a payment his campaign made to a primary opponent in 2012.\nBrady's campaign gave a city judge who challenged him in the 2012 primary $90,000 to quit the race, according to the plea memo unsealed after the judge's campaign aide pleaded guilty to breaking campaign finance laws. And Brady himself tried to \"influence\" a witness in the case, according to prosecutors, who said they filed the case under seal for fear he would \"corrupt(ly)\" pressure the aide not to cooperate.\nBrady has denied any wrongdoing and was not charged. Last month, a political consultant for Brady pleaded guilty to lying about the payment.", "url": "https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3354899"}

{"text": "ABC News Live: Trump, North Korea and Hawaii\n\nTranscript for ABC News Live: Trump, North Korea and Hawaii\nHey I hope governor gray day got exactly keys here in the ABC news live our own we appreciate you. Joining us today we're gonna touch on some of the biggest stories. From around the globe check out this way here these are some shots of the recovery effort happening. In Puerto Rico they're also preparing for hurricane season we're going to be joined on the phone by our producer Josh holiest and then. Check out some of these shut these are overnight shots from Hawaii. In that relentless hurricane down there are correspondent whit Johnson would join us Deborah first Benigno. To the White House in be joined by Karen Travers of course Donald Trump last night with they. Campaign style speech in Nashville Tennessee touch him when he calls spy gate he woke up this morning got into. This back and forth he has with Jeff Sessions Karen Travers first off. What's new with this back and forth between the presidents and Jeff Sessions. Had this is another chapter in an ongoing stock at between president Tran and his attorney general Jeff Sessions in factory last year he called him. Our beleaguered EG he not been shy about putting out public criticisms of action. And all of stems from his frustration that Jeff Sessions recused himself from the Russia wrote remember a year and a half ago. That was all because of Jeff Sessions own contacts with Russian officials to report New York Times that talks about different and anger boiling over once again on this issue. And this thing that congressman tree got in line at the president was talking on television and said that. He understands the president's frustration thing you know he would have also been upset its session. Had told him before accepting the job that he might have to step away from the rusher broke. The president. Quoting trade Goudie on Twitter this morning and here's a great quote. Dowdy said there a lot of really good lawyers in the country heat meaning the president could pick somebody else the president said. And I wish I am very very strong statement. But again just another layer to this ongoing saga between the two on the residence has left Jeff Sessions hanging in the way in many times over the past year. Now the president has said that the Obama FBI infiltrated his campaign is there anything to substantiate those clamps. There's still no evidence to back this happened that entered trade Audi one more time so the president likely hearing wintry Gotti talking about frustration with Jeff Sessions. Trade Goudie last night said that after everything he got last week classified briefing from the FBI and Justice Department officials. He says there is no evidence to suggest that with any politics. Or spy infiltrating the trump campaign. Trade Goudie said that the FBI did exactly what they should have done by having an informant reach out to turn campaign officials. Packer notably we did see the president quoting that part of tree Goudie statements over the last four hours certainly picking and choosing the one that he agreed. Ken Travis force that the White House thank you so much Karen have a great day. Never gonna head out to out to London we're gonna talk with a bit more about trump in this North Korea summit that. On again off again we're joined by Terry Moran from Marlboro in London. Big meeting today Terry between Pompeii oh. And North Korean air North Korean representative here in New York City with a meeting all about. Well it's an extraordinary meeting it only happened once before where North Korean and American officials have met on US soil and Kim Jung on sent his right hand man. This is Kim young told is his name. He has long been a long time associated with the Kim family former spy chief he actually started out life as a body guard for the family tell he's close he's the guy. As negative state Mike Pompeo sitting down with him today in. New York and there have a bay that got a big job ahead of him they've got to try. Under incredible time pressure to come up with and agenda. For this summit that clearly did Donald Trump and Kim Jung on very much want. An agenda for the denuclearization. Of North Korea that is an enormously complex difficult issue the CIA in a report. That is that has been. Released to members of congress and others have said that that they don't believe that North Korea ever will fully. So this is a tall order for Pompeo and for Kim young Joseph but as I say their bosses. Donald Trump and Kim Jung on. They want this done and so it's this crash preparation. For a summit not just in New York but a while all this is happening there are American and North Korean officials meeting in Singapore. Where that summit supposed to happen on June 12 they're trying to hammer out enormously complicated logistics imagined security and rooms in the rest of it. So in the lot lot of work being done scrambling on the diplomatic front. To do what these two leaders want to do get a room get mad at a table and cut a deal. Terry Guinea's cent to what could this mean for the president if he's able to pull good so. What would be extraordinary if he's able to pull but the court does pull what off. A meeting with with the North Korean leader is a moment a very high spectacular. International drama. No president has done it before because they didn't trust that regime didn't Dick they'd get anything from did they give this enormous prestige and and the recognition. Of North Korea is owed family dynasty the Qin dynasty as on a par. With the presidency of the United States didn't want to give that without something in return. President trump is confident he will get that a lot of people around him. Are not and one of the things you're seeing in this on again off again may be on again summit. Is that while these two leaders as I say our. Boldly moved trying to get to that negotiating table they are each. Dealing with national security establishments. Who don't really want to do this on this time frame anyway who are deeply skeptical. There's history in both the Pentagon and the CIA and the State Department. And in the North Korean equivalent of those of dis trust not trusting the other of not believing that. That anything is possible here so it is if both leaders trying to push through their bureaucracy. To get to that table. If they do it will be spectacular. But it will only really mean. A legacy for president trump if the deal is real verifiable. And done. Terry Moran forests in London they can somewhat for all your insight Terry appear great fit. You bet thanks acting. The problem return now to the latest from this attack in Belgian. We have our correspondent James long man out there with the all the latest information. But we have been learning more about not horrific attack on cheese state it killed three people hey. Now authorities have been giving us more information about individual Benjamin home in the 36 year old who they believe carried out. This attack. We understand he may have been radicalized in prison and as any on Tuesday need Forte Allen leave from prison when he committed. These murders. I'm also learning that he may also have been responsible for another load the night before just hours off the meeting prison. It's though he went to the home all of former cellmate at this from prison and bludgeoned him to death and in the next day. Went on his Rampage. Townsend. Let me just say you at a debate about where we offices. You know yes it's a small town. This has been a huge shock I think the people hey I'm particularly. When it comes to the victims these two police women both mothers won a mother of thirteen year old queen. Gals they would ordeals that all of us. Which means now thanks to the rebels. Now been within minutes terribly terribly sad and not reason people are becoming a whole night today that tributes and other. Floral tribute. Similar to the kinds of things that we've seen in other towns and cities a pro Sierra. And it's right on the spot lad those two women were killed because Benjamin ominous thought to have been on the tonight approach states tape these women found them. Today comes from them and then shot them dead and it was right here on the street backed you can see where shell casings have been circles. By police. In their investigation. Stop the killing. Phase two women he then took their gums and started spraying bullets. Taking another individual 22 year old who's sitting in on line moments we think he was sitting in the call alongside his moment. She of course and that's what's parents on dying from. I mean just about every stage of this attack. Some pretty gruesome and very area sixty. Does he continued. Out this Rhodes it then alleged that he thought shout out and I'll walk which is given and authorities data sense that this was. Terrorist attack Ella meaning what is right of course he carried on out pay any made its way up that to the school where he ran inside he took. One woman hostage before then running back counts again and by that time social media. Tells us with people filming from that balcony there the police had swarmed the area it was a huge group a bomb these societies over the right. Cut him down. It's a tremendously dramatic scene and on Tuesday a lot of questions. For authorities to offs and now. I'm gentleman ABC news in yet. James Longman forests and les we turn now. To the political shakeup in Missouri Eric Wright and has been defiant but yesterday the governor announced that he will be stepping down I'm joined now. By Alex Torres who is in Jefferson City, Missouri I mean this guy was once considered a rising star Alex. Who now win in what now in who takes over. While pay Zachary the lieutenant governor's had to be taking over that's right we are in Jeff city. As the locals call articulate that is the State Capitol building it was inside that building act on the renovations now you can see inside that building that. Legislators spent a lot of time. Working on the impeachment process trying to impeach the governor but. They won't have to do that anymore because the governor in a surprise decision. Has announced that he is resigning he is stepping down the governor buckling to bipartisan pressure. You step out of office now all of this really start it will back up a little bit back when he was charged with felony invasion of privacy. Now those charges stem from allegations. From a one man he had an affair with before he was governor now that woman. Claim that the governor took a partially nude photo of her with out her consent and threatened to distribute that photo if she told anyone about their sexual encounters. The governor the whole time denied any wrongdoing he did it make to the affair. Now eventually those charges were dismissed but on top of all that he was then facing. A separate criminal case where he's at views of illegally obtaining. A list of donors using that list to out fund raise for his campaign. The governor was facing a lot of legal troubles that cars are really starting to stack up against him. And at this point in making that announcement the governor said it was those legal fees that were mounting and the told that this has had. And his family that forced them to finally after for months saying he would not step down. To finally make that decision and resign so his resignation becomes official here June 1 Zachary. Yeah Alex you know the governor says he didn't break any laws you've called it a political witch hunt I mean what's the general center around Jefferson City is his political career over at this point. Well you know the governor has. Safe to say probably no friends left here in Jefferson City he was once seen as were rising star in the Republican Party he even. I had reserve though web site that domain Eric Wright is for president so this is clearly a governor who had aspirations to do. Something much bigger than what he was doing now but. These legal troubles really just cause them to lose any and all support across the state this was a bipartisan effort to really get him. Out of office those impeachment proceedings had started legislators were in special session and they were willing to continue working through the summer. And do whatever it took to really investigate briefings bring things to light and eventually impeached discover. Alex thank you so. A much have a great that. Where to go now to Puerto Rico where there. Making way for working prep that there are getting some new numbers in related. To death poll numbers were joined now by Josh toy is on the phone he's one of our producers are just touched down there.

Yup so yes Larry harper university. Study which gave arranged to doubt they said that the number of doubt that. They have been able to. Sort of figure out pastor council survey on the Iowa with a pre. But certainly I'm more than what he current debt hole official government debt sold and that that it. Before this Harvard study that 4006 current debt occurred on the island in the days following Kirk in Maria and also he got. Later on don't be beaten stormont it is a Morton's fixing the root of their home would you destroyed it McCartney tell often die. At that sort of gray area up in investigators aren't worked.

{"text": "Apollo 12\n\nApollo 12 (November 14–24, 1969) was the sixth crewed flight in the United States Apollo program and the second to land on the Moon. It was launched on November 14, 1969, by NASA from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida. Commander Charles \"Pete\" Conrad and Lunar Module Pilot Alan L. Bean performed just over one day and seven hours of lunar surface activity while Command Module Pilot Richard F. Gordon remained in lunar orbit.\n\nApollo 12 would have attempted the first lunar landing had Apollo 11 failed, but after the success of Neil Armstrong's mission, Apollo 12 was postponed by two months, and other Apollo missions also put on a more relaxed schedule. More time was allotted for geologic training in preparation for Apollo 12 than for Apollo 11, Conrad and Bean making several geology field trips in preparation for their mission. Apollo 12's spacecraft and launch vehicle were almost identical to Apollo 11's. One addition was hammocks to allow Conrad and Bean to rest more comfortably on the Moon.\n\nShortly after being launched on a rainy day at Kennedy Space Center, Apollo 12 was twice struck by lightning, causing instrumentation problems but little damage. Switching to the auxiliary power supply resolved the data relay problem, saving the mission. The outward journey to the Moon otherwise saw few problems. On November 19, Conrad and Bean achieved a precise landing at their expected location within walking distance of the Surveyor 3 robotic probe, which had landed on April 20, 1967. In making a pinpoint landing, they showed that NASA could plan future missions in the expectation that astronauts could land close to sites of scientific interest. Conrad and Bean carried the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package, a group of nuclear-powered scientific instruments, as well as the first color television camera taken by an Apollo mission to the lunar surface, but transmission was lost after Bean accidentally pointed the camera at the Sun and its sensor was destroyed. On the second of two moonwalks, they visited Surveyor 3 and removed parts for return to Earth.\n\nLunar Module Intrepid lifted off from the Moon on November 20 and docked with the command module, which subsequently traveled back to Earth. The Apollo 12 mission ended on November 24 with a successful splashdown.\n\nCrew and key Mission Control personnel \n\nThe commander of the all-Navy Apollo 12 crew was Charles \"Pete\" Conrad, who was 39 years old at the time of the mission. After receiving a bachelor's degree in aeronautical engineering from Princeton University in 1953, he became a naval aviator, and completed United States Naval Test Pilot School at Patuxent River Naval Air Station. He was selected in the second group of astronauts in 1962, and flew on Gemini 5 in 1965, and as command pilot of Gemini 11 in 1966. Command Module Pilot Richard \"Dick\" Gordon, 40 years old at the time of Apollo 12, also became a naval aviator in 1953, following graduation from the University of Washington with a degree in chemistry, and completed test pilot school at Patuxent River. Selected as a Group 3 astronaut in 1963, he flew with Conrad on Gemini 11.\n\nThe original Lunar Module pilot assigned to work with Conrad was Clifton C. Williams Jr., who was killed in October 1967 when the T-38 he was flying crashed near Tallahassee. When forming his crew, Conrad had wanted Alan L. Bean, a former student of his at the test pilot school, but had been told by Director of Flight Crew Operations Deke Slayton that Bean was unavailable due to an assignment to the Apollo Applications Program. After Williams's death, Conrad asked for Bean again, and this time Slayton yielded. Bean, 37 years old when the mission flew, had graduated from the University of Texas in 1955 with a degree in aeronautical engineering. Also a naval aviator, he was selected alongside Gordon in 1963, and first flew in space on Apollo 12.  The three Apollo 12 crew members had backed up Apollo 9 earlier in 1969.\n\nThe Apollo 12 backup crew was David R. Scott as commander, Alfred M. Worden as Command Module pilot, and James B. Irwin as Lunar Module pilot. They became the crew of Apollo 15. For Apollo, a third crew of astronauts, known as the support crew, was designated in addition to the prime and backup crews used on projects Mercury and Gemini. Slayton created the support crews because James McDivitt, who would command Apollo 9, believed that, with preparation going on in facilities across the US, meetings that needed a member of the flight crew would be missed. Support crew members were to assist as directed by the mission commander. Usually low in seniority, they assembled the mission's rules, flight plan, and checklists, and kept them updated; For Apollo 12, they were Gerald P. Carr, Edward G. Gibson and Paul J. Weitz. Flight directors were Gerry Griffin, first shift, Pete Frank, second shift, Clifford E. Charlesworth, third shift, and Milton Windler, fourth shift. Flight directors during Apollo had a one-sentence job description, \"The flight director may take any actions necessary for crew safety and mission success.\" Capsule communicators (CAPCOMs) were Scott, Worden, Irwin, Carr, Gibson, Weitz and Don Lind.\n\nPreparation\n\nSite selection \nThe landing site selection process for Apollo 12 was greatly informed by the site selection for Apollo 11. There were rigid standards for the possible Apollo 11 landing sites, in which scientific interest was not a major factor: they had to be close to the lunar equator and not on the periphery of the portion of the lunar surface visible from Earth; they had to be relatively flat and without major obstructions along the path the Lunar Module (LM) would fly to reach them, their suitability confirmed by photographs from Lunar Orbiter probes. Also desirable was the presence of another suitable site further west in case the mission was delayed, and the sun would have risen too high in the sky at the original site for desired lighting conditions. The need for three days to recycle if a launch had to be scrubbed meant that only three of the five suitable sites found were designated as potential landing sites for Apollo 11, of which the Apollo 11 landing site in the Sea of Tranquility was the easternmost. Since Apollo 12 was to attempt the first lunar landing if Apollo 11 failed, both sets of astronauts trained for the same sites.\n\nWith the success of Apollo 11, it was initially contemplated that Apollo 12 would land at the site next further west from the Sea of Tranquility, in Sinus Medii. However, NASA planning coordinator Jack Sevier and engineers at the Manned Spaceflight Center at Houston argued for a landing close enough to the crater in which the Surveyor 3 probe had landed in 1967 to allow the astronauts to cut parts from it for return to Earth. The site was otherwise suitable and had scientific interest. Given that Apollo 11 had landed several miles off-target, though, some NASA administrators feared Apollo 12 would land far enough away that the astronauts could not reach the probe, and the agency would be embarrassed. Nevertheless, the ability to perform pinpoint landings was essential if Apollo's exploration program was to be carried out, and on July 25, 1969, Apollo Program Manager Samuel Phillips designated what became known as Surveyor crater as the landing site, despite the unanimous opposition of members of two site selection boards.\n\nTraining and preparation \n\nThe Apollo 12 astronauts spent five hours in mission-specific training for every hour they expected to spend in flight on the mission, a total exceeding 1,000 hours per crew member. Conrad and Bean received more mission-specific training than Apollo 11's Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin had. This was in addition to the 1,500 hours of training they received as backup crew members for Apollo 9. The Apollo 12 training included over 400 hours per crew member in simulators of the Command Module (CM) and of the LM. Some of the simulations were linked in real time to flight controllers in Mission Control. To practice landing on the Moon, Conrad flew the Lunar Landing Training Vehicle (LLTV), training in which continued to be authorized even though Armstrong had been forced to bail out of a similar vehicle in 1968, just before it crashed.\n\nSoon after being assigned as Apollo 12 crew commander, Conrad met with NASA geologists and told them that the training for lunar surface activities would be conducted much as Apollo 11's, but there was to be no publicity or involvement by the media. Conrad felt he had been abused by the press during Gemini, and the sole Apollo 11 geology field trip had turned into a near-fiasco, with a large media contingent present, some getting in the way—the astronauts had trouble hearing each other due to a hovering press helicopter. After the successful return of Apollo 11 in July 1969, more time was allotted for geology, but the astronauts' focus was in getting time in the simulators without being pre-empted by the Apollo 11 crew. On the six Apollo 12 geology field trips, the astronauts would practice as if on the Moon, collecting samples and documenting them with photographs, while communicating with a CAPCOM and geologists who were out of sight in a nearby tent. Afterwards, the astronauts' performance in choosing samples and taking photographs would be critiqued. To the frustration of the astronauts, the scientists kept changing the photo documentation procedures; after the fourth or fifth such change, Conrad required that there be no more. After the return of Apollo 11, the Apollo 12 crew was able to view the lunar samples, and be briefed on them by scientists.\n\nAs Apollo 11 was targeted for an ellipse-shaped landing zone, rather than at a specific point, there was no planning for geology traverses, the designated tasks to be done at sites of the crew's choosing. For Apollo 12, before the mission, some of NASA's geology team met with the crew and Conrad suggested they lay out possible routes for him and Bean. The result was four traverses, based on four potential landing points for the LM. This was the start of geology traverse planning that on later missions became a considerable effort involving several organizations.\n\nThe stages of the lunar module, LM–6, were delivered to Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on March 24, 1969, and were mated to each other on April 28. Command module CM–108 and service module SM–108 were delivered to KSC on March 28, and were mated to each other on April 21. Following installation of gear and testing, the launch vehicle, with the spacecraft atop it, was rolled out to Launch Complex 39A on September 8, 1969. The training schedule was complete, as planned, by November 1, 1969; activities after that date were intended as refreshers. The crew members felt that the training, for the most part, was adequate preparation for the Moon mission.\n\nHardware\n\nLaunch vehicle \n\nThere were no significant changes to the Saturn V launch vehicle used on Apollo 12, SA–507, from that used on Apollo 11. There were another 17 instrumentation measurements in the Apollo 12 launch vehicle, bringing the number to 1,365. The entire vehicle, including the spacecraft, weighed  at launch, an increase from Apollo 11's . Of this figure, the spacecraft weighed , up from  on Apollo 11.\n\nThird stage trajectory \nAfter LM separation, the third stage of the Saturn V, the S-IVB, was intended to fly into solar orbit. The S-IVB auxiliary propulsion system was fired, with the intent that the Moon's gravity slingshot the stage into solar orbit. Due to an error, the S-IVB flew past the Moon at too high an altitude to achieve Earth escape velocity. It remained in a semi-stable Earth orbit until it finally escaped Earth orbit in 1971, but briefly returned to Earth orbit 31 years later. It was discovered by amateur astronomer Bill Yeung who gave it the temporary designation J002E3 before it was determined to be an artificial object. Again in solar orbit as of 2021, it may again be captured by Earth's gravity, but not at least until the 2040s. The S-IVBs used on later lunar missions were deliberately crashed into the Moon to create seismic events that would register on the seismometers left on the Moon and provide data about the Moon's structure.\n\nSpacecraft \n\nThe Apollo 12 spacecraft consisted of Command Module 108 and Service Module 108 (together Command and Service Modules 108, or CSM–108), Lunar Module 6 (LM–6), a Launch Escape System (LES), and Spacecraft-Lunar Module Adapter 15 (SLA–15). The LES contained three rocket motors to propel the CM to safety in the event of an abort shortly after launch, while the SLA housed the LM and provided a structural connection between the Saturn V and the LM. The SLA was identical to Apollo 11's, while the LES differed only in the installation of a more reliable motor igniter.\n\nThe CSM was given the call sign Yankee Clipper, while the LM had the call sign Intrepid. These sea-related names were selected by the all-Navy crew from several thousand proposed names submitted by employees of the prime contractors of the respective modules. George Glacken, a flight test engineer at North American Aviation, builder of the CSM, proposed Yankee Clipper as such ships had \"majestically sailed the high seas with pride and prestige for a new America\". Intrepid was from a suggestion by Robert Lambert, a planner at Grumman, builder of the LM, as evocative of \"this nation's resolute determination for continued exploration of space, stressing our astronauts' fortitude and endurance of hardship\".\n\nThe differences between the CSM and LM of Apollo 11, and those of Apollo 12, were few and minor. A hydrogen separator was added to the CSM to stop the gas from entering the potable water tank—Apollo 11 had had one, though mounted on the water dispenser in the CM's cabin. Gaseous hydrogen in the water had given the Apollo 11 crew severe flatulence. Other changes included the strengthening of the recovery loop attached following splashdown, meaning that the swimmers recovering the CM would not have to attach an auxiliary loop. LM changes included a structural modification so that scientific experiment packages could be carried for deployment on the lunar surface. Two hammocks were added for greater comfort of the astronauts while resting on the Moon, and a color television camera substituted for the black and white one used on the lunar surface during Apollo 11.\n\nALSEP \n\nThe Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package, or ALSEP, was a suite of scientific instruments designed to be emplaced on the lunar surface by the Apollo astronauts, and thereafter operate autonomously, sending data to Earth. Development of the ALSEP was part of NASA's response to some scientists who opposed the crewed lunar landing program (they felt that robotic craft could explore the Moon more cheaply) by demonstrating that some tasks, such as deployment of the ALSEP, required humans. In 1966, a contract to design and build the ALSEPs was awarded to the Bendix Corporation Due to the limited time the Apollo 11 crew would have on the lunar surface, a smaller suite of experiments was flown, known as the Early Apollo Surface Experiment Package (EASEP). Apollo 12 was the first mission to carry an ALSEP; one would be flown on each of the subsequent lunar landing missions, though the components that were included would vary. Apollo 12's ALSEP was to be deployed at least  away from the LM to protect the instruments from the debris that would be generated when the ascent stage of the LM took off to return the astronauts to lunar orbit.\n\nApollo 12's ALSEP included a Lunar Surface Magnetometer (LSM), to measure the magnetic field at the Moon's surface, a Lunar Atmosphere Detector (LAD, also known as the Cold Cathode Ion Gauge Experiment), intended to measure the density and temperature of the thin lunar atmosphere and how it varies, a Lunar Ionosphere Detector (LID, also known as the Charged Particle Lunar Environment Experiment, or CPLEE), intended to study the charged particles in the lunar atmosphere, and the Solar Wind Spectrometer, to measure the strength and direction of the solar wind at the Moon's surface—the free-standing Solar Wind Composition Experiment, to measure what makes up the solar wind, would be deployed and then brought back to Earth by the astronauts. A Dust Detector was used to measure the accumulation of lunar dust on the equipment. Apollo 12's Passive Seismic Experiment (PSE), a seismometer, would measure moonquakes and other movements in the Moon's crust, and would be calibrated by the nearby planned impact of the ascent stage of Apollo 12's LM, an object of known mass and velocity hitting the Moon at a known location, and projected to be equivalent to the explosive force of one ton of TNT.\n\nThe ALSEP experiments left on the Moon by Apollo 12 were connected to a Central Station, which contained a transmitter, receiver, timer, data processor, and equipment for power distribution and control of the experiments. The equipment was powered by SNAP-27, a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) developed by the Atomic Energy Commission. Containing plutonium, the RTG flown on Apollo 12 was the first use of atomic energy on a crewed NASA spacecraft—some NASA and military satellites had previously used similar systems. The plutonium core was brought from Earth in a cask attached to an LM landing leg, a container designed to survive re-entry in the event of an aborted mission, something NASA considered unlikely. The cask would survive re-entry on Apollo 13, sinking in the Tonga Trench of the Pacific Ocean, apparently without radioactive leakage.\n\nThe Apollo 12 ALSEP experiments were activated from Earth on November 19, 1969. The LAD returned only a small amount of useful data due to the failure of its power supply soon after activation. The LSM was deactivated on June 14, 1974, as was the other LSM deployed on the Moon, from Apollo 15. All powered ALSEP experiments that remained active were deactivated on September 30, 1977, principally because of budgetary constraints.\n\nMission highlights\n\nLaunch\nWith President Richard Nixon in attendance, the first time a current U.S. president had witnessed a crewed space launch, as well as Vice President Spiro Agnew, Apollo 12 launched as planned at 11:22:00 on November 14, 1969 (16:22:00 UT) from Kennedy Space Center. This was at the start of a launch window of three hours and four minutes to reach the Moon with optimal lighting conditions at the planned landing point. There were completely overcast rainy skies, and the vehicle encountered winds of  during ascent, the strongest of any Apollo mission. There was a NASA rule against launching into a cumulonimbus cloud; this had been waived and it was later determined that the launch vehicle never entered such a cloud. Had the mission been postponed, it could have been launched on November 16 with landing at a backup site where there would be no Surveyor, but since time pressure to achieve a lunar landing had been removed by Apollo 11's success, NASA might have waited until December for the next opportunity to go to the Surveyor crater.\n\nLightning struck the Saturn V 36.5 seconds after lift-off, triggered by the vehicle itself. The static discharge caused a voltage transient that knocked all three fuel cells offline, meaning the spacecraft was being powered entirely from its batteries, which could not supply enough current to meet demand. A second strike at 52 seconds knocked out the \"8-ball\" attitude indicator. The telemetry stream at Mission Control was garbled, but the Saturn V continued to fly normally; the strikes had not affected the Saturn V instrument unit guidance system, which functioned independently from the CSM. The astronauts unexpectedly had a board red with caution and warning lights, but could not tell exactly what was wrong.\n\nThe Electrical, Environmental and Consumables Manager (EECOM) in Mission Control, John Aaron, remembered the telemetry failure pattern from an earlier test when a power loss caused a malfunction in the CSM signal conditioning electronics (SCE), which converted raw signals from instrumentation to data that could be displayed on Mission Control's consoles, and knew how to fix it. Aaron made a call, \"Flight, EECOM. Try SCE to Aux\", to switch the SCE to a backup power supply. The switch was fairly obscure, and neither Flight Director Gerald Griffin, CAPCOM Gerald P. Carr, nor Conrad knew what it was; Bean, who as LMP was the spacecraft's engineer, knew where to find it and threw the switch, after which the telemetry came back online, revealing no significant malfunctions. Bean put the fuel cells back online, and the mission continued. Once in Earth parking orbit, the crew carefully checked out their spacecraft before re-igniting the S-IVB third stage for trans-lunar injection. The lightning strikes caused no serious permanent damage.\n\nInitially, it was feared that the lightning strike could have damaged the explosive bolts that opened the Command Module's parachute compartment. The decision was made not to share this with the astronauts and to continue with the flight plan, since they would die if the parachutes failed to deploy, whether following an Earth-orbit abort or upon a return from the Moon, so nothing was to be gained by aborting. The parachutes deployed and functioned normally at the end of the mission.\n\nOutward journey\n\nAfter systems checks in Earth orbit, performed with great care because of the lightning strikes, the trans-lunar injection burn, made with the S-IVB, took place at 02:47:22.80 into the mission, setting Apollo 12 on course for the Moon. An hour and twenty minutes later, the CSM separated from the S-IVB, after which Gordon performed the transposition, docking and extracting maneuver to dock with the LM and separate the combined craft from the S-IVB, which was then sent on an attempt to reach solar orbit. The stage fired its engines to leave the vicinity of the spacecraft, a change from Apollo 11, where the SM's Service Propulsion System (SPS) engine was used to distance it from the S-IVB.\n\nAs there were concerns the LM might have been damaged by the lightning strikes, Conrad and Bean entered it on the first day of flight to check its status, earlier than planned. They found no issues. At 30:52.44.36, the only necessary midcourse correction during the translunar coast was made, placing the craft on a hybrid, non-free-return trajectory. Previous crewed missions to lunar orbit had taken a free-return trajectory, allowing an easy return to Earth if the craft's engines did not fire to enter lunar orbit. Apollo 12 was the first crewed spacecraft to take a hybrid free-return trajectory, that would require another burn to return to Earth, but one that could be executed by the LM's Descent Propulsion System (DPS) if the SPS failed. The use of a hybrid trajectory allowed more flexibility in mission planning. It for example allowed Apollo 12 to launch in daylight and reach the planned landing spot on schedule. Use of a hybrid trajectory meant that Apollo 12 took 8 hours longer to go from trans-lunar injection to lunar orbit.\n\nLunar orbit and Moon landing\n\nApollo 12 entered a lunar orbit of  with an SPS burn of 352.25 seconds at mission time 83:25:26.36. On the first lunar orbit, there was a television transmission that resulted in good-quality video of the lunar surface. On the third lunar orbit, there was another burn to circularize the craft's orbit to , and on the next revolution, preparations began for the lunar landing. The CSM and LM undocked at 107:54:02.3; a half hour later there was a burn by the CSM to separate them. The 14.4 second burn by some of the CSM's thrusters meant that the two craft would be  apart when the LM began the burn to move to a lower orbit in preparation for landing on the Moon.\n\nThe LM's Descent Propulsion System began a 29-second burn at 109:23:39.9 to move the craft to the lower orbit, from which the 717-second powered descent to the lunar surface began at 110:20:38.1. Conrad had trained to expect a pattern of craters known as \"the Snowman\" to be visible when the craft underwent \"pitchover\", with the Surveyor crater in its center, but had feared he would see nothing recognizable. He was astonished to see the Snowman right where it should be, meaning they were directly on course. He took over manual control, planning to land the LM, as he had in simulations, in an area near the Surveyor crater that had been dubbed \"Pete's Parking Lot\", but found it rougher than expected. He had to maneuver, and landed the LM\nat 110:32:36.2 (06:54:36 UT on November 19, 1969), just  from the Surveyor probe. This achieved one objective of the mission, to perform a precision landing near the Surveyor craft.\n\nThe lunar coordinates of the landing site were 3.01239° S latitude, 23.42157° W longitude. The landing caused high velocity sandblasting of the Surveyor probe. It was later determined that the sandblasting removed more dust than it delivered onto the Surveyor, because the probe was covered by a thin layer that gave it a tan hue as observed by the astronauts, and every portion of the surface exposed to the direct sandblasting was lightened back toward the original white color through the removal of lunar dust.\n\nLunar surface activities\nWhen Conrad, the shortest man of the initial groups of astronauts, stepped onto the lunar surface his first words were \"Whoopie! Man, that may have been a small one for Neil, but that's a long one for me.\" This was not an off-the-cuff remark: Conrad had made a  bet with reporter Oriana Fallaci he would say these words, after she had queried whether NASA had instructed Neil Armstrong what to say as he stepped onto the Moon. Conrad later said he was never able to collect the money.\n\nTo improve the quality of television pictures from the Moon, a color camera was carried on Apollo 12 (unlike the monochrome camera on Apollo 11). When Bean carried the camera to the place near the LM where it was to be set up, he inadvertently pointed it directly into the Sun, destroying the Secondary Electron Conduction (SEC) tube. Television coverage of this mission was thus terminated almost immediately.\n\nAfter raising a U.S. flag on the Moon, Conrad and Bean devoted much of the remainder of the first EVA to deploying the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP). There were minor difficulties with the deployment. Bean had trouble extracting the RTG's plutonium fuel element from its protective cask, and the astronauts had to resort to the use of a hammer to hit the cask and dislodge the fuel element. Some of the ALSEP packages proved hard to deploy, though the astronauts were successful in all cases. With the PSE able to detect their footprints as they headed back to the LM, the astronauts secured a core tube full of lunar material, and collected other samples. The first EVA lasted 3 hours, 56 minutes and 3 seconds.\n\nFour possible geologic traverses had been planned, the variable being where the LM might set down. Conrad had landed it between two of these potential landing points, and during the first EVA and the rest break that followed, scientists in Houston combined two of the traverses into one that Conrad and Bean could follow from their landing point. The resultant traverse resembled a rough circle, and when the astronauts emerged from the LM some 13 hours after ending the first EVA, the first stop was Head crater, some  from the LM. There, Bean noticed that Conrad's footprints showed lighter material underneath, indicating the presence of ejecta from Copernicus crater,  to the north, something that scientists examining overhead photographs of the site had hoped to find. After the mission, samples from Head allowed geologists to date the impact that formed Copernicus—according to initial dating, some 810,000,000 years ago.\n\nThe astronauts proceeded to Bench crater and Sharp crater and past Halo crater before arriving at Surveyor crater, where the Surveyor 3 probe had landed. Fearing treacherous footing or that the probe might topple on them, they approached Surveyor cautiously, descending into the shallow crater some distance away and then following a contour to reach the craft, but found the footing solid and the probe stable. They collected several pieces of Surveyor, including the television camera, as well as taking rocks that had been studied by television. Conrad and Bean had procured an automatic timer for their Hasselblad cameras, and had brought it with them without telling Mission Control, hoping to take a selfie of the two of them with the probe, but when the time came to use it, could not locate it among the lunar samples they had already placed in their Hand Tool Carrier. Before returning to the LM's vicinity, Conrad and Bean went to Block crater, within Surveyor crater. The second EVA lasted 3 hours, 49 minutes, 15 seconds, during which they traveled . During the EVAs, Conrad and Bean went as far as  from the LM, and collected  of samples.\n\nLunar orbit solo activities \n\nAfter the LM's departure, Gordon had little to say as Mission Control focused on the lunar landing. Once that was accomplished, Gordon sent his congratulations and, on the next orbit, was able to spot both the LM and the Surveyor on the ground and convey their locations to Houston. During the first EVA, Gordon prepared for a plane change maneuver, a burn to alter the CSM's orbit to compensate for the rotation of the Moon, though at times he had difficulty communicating with Houston since Conrad and Bean were using the same communications circuit. Once the two moonwalkers had returned to the LM, Gordon executed the burn, which ensured he would be in the proper position to rendezvous with the LM when it launched from the Moon.\n\nWhile alone in orbit, Gordon performed the Lunar Multispectral Photography Experiment, using four Hasselblad cameras arranged in a ring and aimed through one of the CM's windows. With each camera having a different color filter, simultaneous photos would be taken by each, showing the appearance of lunar features at different points on the spectrum. Analysis of the images might reveal colors not visible to the naked eye or detectable with ordinary color film, and information could be obtained about the composition of sites that would not soon be visited by humans. Among the sites studied were contemplated landing points for future Apollo missions.\n\nReturn\n\nLM Intrepid lifted off from the Moon at mission time 143:03:47.78, or 14:25:47 UT on November 20, 1969; after several maneuvers, CSM and LM docked three and a half hours later. At 147:59:31.6, the LM ascent stage was jettisoned, and shortly thereafter the CSM maneuvered away. Under control from Earth, the LM's remaining propellent was depleted in a burn that caused it to impact the Moon  from the Apollo 12 landing point.  The seismometer the astronauts had left on the lunar surface registered the resulting vibrations for more than an hour.\n\nThe crew stayed another day in lunar orbit taking photographs of the surface, including of candidate sites for future Apollo landings. A second plane change maneuver was made at 159:04:45.47, lasting 19.25 seconds.\n\nThe trans-Earth injection burn, to send the CSM Yankee Clipper towards home, was conducted at 172:27:16.81 and lasted 130.32 seconds. Two short midcourse correction burns were made en route. A final television broadcast was made, the astronauts answering questions submitted by the media. There was ample time for rest on the way back to Earth, One event was the photography of a solar eclipse that occurred when the Earth came between the spacecraft and the Sun; Bean described it as the most spectacular sight of the mission.\n\nSplashdown\nYankee Clipper returned to Earth on November 24, 1969, at 20:58 UT (3:58pm Eastern Time, 10:58am HST), in the Pacific Ocean. The landing was hard, resulting in a camera becoming dislodged and striking Bean in the forehead. After recovery by , they entered the Mobile Quarantine Facility (MQF), while lunar samples and Surveyor parts were sent ahead by air to the Lunar Receiving Laboratory (LRL) in Houston. Once the Hornet docked in Hawaii, the MQF was offloaded and flown to Ellington Air Force Base near Houston on November 29, from where it was taken to the LRL, where the astronauts remained until released from quarantine on December 10.\n\nMission insignia\n\nThe Apollo 12 mission patch shows the crew's naval background; all three astronauts at the time of the mission were U.S. Navy commanders. It features a clipper ship arriving at the Moon, representing the CM Yankee Clipper. The ship trails fire, and flies the flag of the United States. The mission name APOLLO XII and the crew names are on a wide gold border, with a small blue trim. Blue and gold are traditional U.S. Navy colors. The patch has four stars on it – one each for the three astronauts who flew the mission and one for Clifton Williams, the original LMP on Conrad's crew who was killed in 1967 and would have flown the mission. The star was placed there at the suggestion of his replacement, Bean.\n\nThe insignia was designed by the crew with the aid of several employees of NASA contractors. The Apollo 12 landing area on the Moon is within the portion of the lunar surface shown on the insignia, based on a photograph of a globe of the Moon, taken by engineers. The clipper ship was based on photographs of such a ship obtained by Bean.\n\nAftermath and spacecraft location\n\nAfter the mission, Conrad urged his crewmates to join him in the Skylab program, seeing in it the best chance of flying in space again. Bean did so—Conrad commanded Skylab 2, the first crewed mission to the space station, while Bean commanded Skylab 3. Gordon, though, still hoped to walk on the Moon and remained with the Apollo program, serving as backup commander of Apollo 15. He was the likely commander of Apollo 18, but that mission was canceled and he did not fly in space again.\n\nThe Apollo 12 command module Yankee Clipper, was displayed at the Paris Air Show and was then placed at NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; ownership was transferred to the Smithsonian in July 1971. It is on display at the Virginia Air and Space Center in Hampton.\n\nMission Control had remotely fired the service module's thrusters after jettison, hoping to have it skip off the atmosphere and enter a high-apogee orbit, but the lack of tracking data confirming this caused it to conclude it most likely burned up in the atmosphere at the time of CM re-entry. The S-IVB is in a solar orbit that is sometimes affected by the Earth.\n\nThe ascent stage of LM Intrepid impacted the Moon November 20, 1969, at 22:17:17.7 UT (5:17pm EST). In 2009, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) photographed the Apollo 12 landing site, where the descent stage, ALSEP, Surveyor3 spacecraft, and astronaut footpaths remain. In 2011, the LRO returned to the landing site at a lower altitude to take higher resolution photographs.\n\nSee also\n List of artificial objects on the Moon\n List of spacewalks and moonwalks 1965–1999\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\n\n \"Apollo 12\" at Encyclopedia Astronautica\n \"Apollo 12\" at NASA's National Space Science Data Center\n Apollo 11, 12, and 14 Traverses, at the Lunar and Planetary Institute\n \"Apollo 12 Traverse Map\" at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center\n Lunar Orbiter 3 image 154 H2, used for planning the mission (landing site is left of center).\n Lunar Orbiter 1 sequence of images 157, 158, and 159, showing the Apollo 12 landing site and vicinity\n\nNASA reports\n \"Apollo 12 Preliminary Science Report\" (PDF), NASA, NASA SP-235, 1970\n \"Analysis of Apollo 12 Lightning Incident\", (PDF) February 1970\n \"Analysis of Surveyor 3 material and photographs returned by Apollo 12\" (PDF) 1972\n \"Examination of Surveyor 3 surface sampler scoop\"(PDF) 1971\n \"Table 2-40.

{"text": "Men, Listen Up: Women Like The Smell Of Guys Who Eat A Certain Diet\n\nWhat we eat can influence more than our waistlines. It turns out, our diets also help determine what we smell like.\nA recent study found that women preferred the body odor of men who ate a lot of fruits and vegetables. Whereas men who ate a lot of carbohydrates gave off a smell that was less appealing.\nSkeptical? At first, I was, too. I thought this line of inquiry must have been dreamed up by the produce industry. (Makes a good marketing campaign, right?!)\nBut it's legit. \"We've known for a while that odor is an important component of attractiveness, especially for women,\" says Ian Stephen of Macquarie University in Australia. He studies evolution, genetics and psychology and is an author of the study.\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, scientists say our sweat can help signal our health status, and could possibly play a role in helping attract a mate.\nSo, how did scientists evaluate the link between diet and the attractiveness of body odor?\nThey began by recruiting a bunch of healthy, young men. They assessed the men's skin using an instrument called a spectrophotometer. When people eat a lot of colorful veggies, their skin takes on the hue of carotenoids, the plant pigments that are responsible for bright red, yellow and orange foods.\n\"The carotenoids get deposited in our skin,\" explains Stephen. The spectrophotometer \"flashes a light onto your skin and measures the color reflected back,\" says Stephen. The results are \"a good indicator of how much fruits and vegetables we're eating,\" he says.\nStephen and his colleagues also had the men in the study compete food frequency questionnaires, so they could determine the men's overall patterns of eating. Then, men were given clean T-shirts and asked to do some exercise.\nAfterwards, women in the study were asked to sniff the sweat. (Note: The methodology was much more scientific and precise than my breezy explanation, but you get the picture!) \"We asked the women to rate how much they liked it, how floral, how fruity,\" and a bunch of other descriptors, explains Stephen.\nIt's a small study, but the results were pretty consistent. \"Women basically found that men who ate more vegetables smelled nicer,\" Stephen told us.\nMen who ate a lot of meat did not produce a sweat that was any more — or less — attractive to women. But meat did tend to make men's odor more intense.\n\"This is not the first study to show that diet influences body odor,\" says George Preti, an adjunct professor in the dermatology department at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia.\nA study published in 2006 found that women preferred the odor of men who ate a non-meat diet, \"characterized by increased intakes of eggs, cheese, soy, fruit and vegetables.\"\nBut Preti points out that the relationship between diet and body odor is indirect.\nSome people think if they eat a garlic or onion — or a piece of meat — they will smell like that food. \"But that's not what happens,\" Preti says. Your breath might smell like the food you eat, but not your sweat.\nBody odor is created when the bacteria on our skin metabolize the compounds that come out of our sweat glands.\n\"The sweat doesn't come out smelly,\" Preti explains, \"It must be metabolized by the bacteria that live on the surface of the skin.\"\nNow, of course, at a time when good hygiene and deodorant use are commonplace, is the smell of our sweat a big concern?\nI put that question to the happy-hour crowd at a bar down the street from the NPR headquarters in Washington, D.C.\n\"I'm pretty OK with my smell,\" Stefan Ruffini told me. That evening he was ordering a burger on a bun and a side of fries, along with a beer. When I told him about the findings of the study, he laughed it off.\n\"I've got a girlfriend, so I don't worry about these things!\"he said.\nThe study did not assess diet and odor attractiveness among same-sex couples.\n\"As a lesbian, I haven't smelled a man in several years,\" Stacy Carroll, who was also at happy hour, told me. \"I eat a lot of produce, I have a girlfriend, so it's working out!\"\nCarroll says people who eat a lot of fruits and vegetables are more likely to be interested in their health --\"feeling good, looking fit\" — than their smell.", "url": "http://tpr.org/post/men-listen-women-smell-guys-who-eat-certain-diet"}

{"text": "One of the most talked about and controversial outings from Ubisoft in the Assassin's Creed franchise has to be Assassin's Creed: Unity. The game was hailed as a gorgeous but broken gameplay experience. Well, Ubisoft finally explained exactly what went wrong.\nWe fell again into this trap of working a lot on the tech, and not allowing enough [time for] the teams to create the content to create something new. In the end, that's the way I see it. We created the perfect conditions for the perfect storm. We had a game that was wonderful in terms of art, but that was not renewing enough of the experience.\nGuesdon compared Assassin's Creed: Unity to the original Assassin's Creed that came out in 2007. Jean explained that both games put the tech before the content, and that both games suffered from the problem of the team trying to bring tech to life as opposed to giving gamers a very thorough gameplay experience.\nDevelopment on Unity started back in 2011 and the game was finished in 2014, a year after the Xbox One and PS4 released. It was also the first exclusive eighth-gen outing for the Assassin's Creed franchise, following up on the previous year's cross-gen outing of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag.\nDespite having a three year development cycle, Guesdon notes that focusing on the \"low\" level tech blinded the team from focusing on content-driven gameplay.\nIt does make sense in a way given that most people admit that Assassin's Creed: Unity is one of the best looking games from eighth gen and that the design of France is both densely realized and artistically captivating. Unfortunately, a lot of the exploration and navigation was impeded by graphical glitches, frame-rate issues and performance roadblocks; many of these problems persisted for well after six months of the game's release.\nUbisoft decided to change the way design approaches were made for the games that followed, with Assassin's Creed: Syndicate being more content-focused, while Assassin's Creed: Origins was themed around player-choice and an overhaul of the combat system, which was mirrored after games like Dark Souls and Dragon's Dogma.\nWhat's interesting is that Assassin's Creed: Unity was about putting tech before gameplay, and it didn't quite pay off due to some hiccups that the team should have fixed before it was released. Perhaps if it had six months of extra development time it could have released as an instant classic instead of developing a reputation of a rushed and buggy game.\nThese days people use Assassin's Creed: Unity as an example of a game that didn't bake in the oven long enough. It's a real shame, because it is true that it does a fine job of visually capturing the French Revolution unlike any other game before it.", "url": "https://www.cinemablend.com/games/2391171/what-went-wrong-with-assassins-creed-unity-according-to-ubisoft"}

There have been many similar stories about other job scams in the UAE and I've not heard of any where someone got their money back.\nTL;DR version of information below: The Edison World School in Abu Dhabi currently found online does not exist in real life, and is an example of a common scam where someone advertises teaching jobs at schools in the UAE which don't exist. The scam is that when an offer is made, money is requested to pay for visa processing fees. Never send money for visa fees to any employer or agency in the UAE. If an employer or agency asks for money, assume it is a scam, or the employer is unpleasant to work for if they really exist.\nEdison World School was officially announced in 2011 as a school planned for Abu Dhabi but nothing further developed.

It seems unlikely that the organisation which made the original announcement is involved in the teaching job scam.\nwww.edisonworldsch.com is what appears to be the official school website, however it is copied from the Repton School Abu Dhabi website (Repton is a real school), with Repton School replaced by Edison School or Edison World School, and some other adjustments for address, location, staff names etc. The fake EWS website even has photos of Repton School in Derbyshire, relabeled as photos of EWS.\nRepton Abu Dhabi website wrote: For those families relocating back to the UK, or considering UK Boarding for their child, both Repton and Foremarke Hall (Repton's preparatory school) offers a continuity of curriculum and culture.\nEWS website wrote: For those families relocating back to the UK, or considering UK Boarding for their child, both Edison World School and Foremarke Hall (Edison World School's preparatory school) offers a continuity of curriculum and culture.\nThe headteacher of EWS according to their website is Ms Bianca Anna Gabriel (or Ana).

IL GINOCCHIO DI ARTEMIDE, Francisco Algarín Navarro\nIL GINOCCHIO DI ARTEMIDE , DE JEAN-MARIE STRAUB\n¡Straub sin ella, Straub sin ella!\nLos Straub siempre llegaron con retraso (a nosotros). En cambio, siempre a tiempo (a su tiempo). Como era habitual, el mundo se enteró tarde de la noticia de la muerte de Danièle Huillet. Dos días tarde. El 11 de octubre de 2006, un amigo nos traía la noticia desde el Festival de Vancouver: «Danièle Huillet ha muerto». Ese mismo día salía el obituario en Libération, «Straub sans Huillet»: «Danièle Huillet ha muerto en la noche del lunes al martes. Tenía setenta años». Casi dos años después el Festival de Cannes incluía en su programación dos películas que se presentan en esta edición del BAFICI: Il ginocchio di Artemide e Itinéraire de Jean Bricard. Recuerdo leer en el mismo lugar, pero tantos días después, unas pocas palabras escritas en rojo por el mismo amigo que nos había anunciado su muerte, Álvaro Arroba: «¡Straub sin ella, Straub sin ella!». Mientras Itinéraire era la última película del matrimonio, Il ginocchio di Artemide venía firmada únicamente por Jean-Marie, y ambas acudían de la mano. Inequívocamente, el título en italiano, Il ginocchio di Artemide, nos hacía pensar en Pavese y en Diálogos con Leucó. Y sabíamos que a Danièle y Jean-Marie aún le quedaban, como mínimo, una carta guardada bajo la manga: La Fiera, el sexto capítulo, en el que se encuentran Endimión y el Extranjero.\nCada cual tiene el sueño que le toca, Endimión. Y tu sueño es infinito de voces y de gritos, y de tierra, de cielos, de días. Duérmelo con valor, no posees otro bien. La soledad salvaje es tuya. Ámala cual ella te ama. Y ahora, Endimión, te dejo. La verás esta noche.\nOh, dios viandante, te doy las gracias.\nAdiós, mas no deberás despertarte ya, recuérdalo.\nVolvemos a leer el pasaje de La Fiera antes de ver Il ginocchio di Artemide y, de repente, creemos comprender todo. Entendemos que tras Dalla nube alla resistenza (1979), viniera Quei loro incontri (2006). Entendemos por qué los Straub nunca adaptaron el conjunto de los diálogos de Pavese en una sola película, o por qué nunca escogieron solo fragmentos de ellos, tal y como hicieron, por ejemplo, con la obra de Vittorini. Entendemos también por qué en Quei loro incontri dejaron una última carta en el bolsillo. Sabemos que no puede tratarse únicamente por uno de esos azares de la vida que fuese precisamente La Fiera aquel que restaba. Y cuando leemos «La soledad salvaje es tuya. Ámala cual ella te ama», no podemos conjugar ese tiempo en un imperfecto, sabiendo que debe ser enunciado en presente. Un presente perfecto, que puede ser proclamado tan solo en las profundidades de los bosques de la Toscana, donde permanecen sus huellas. La naturaleza las respeta porque ella la respetó. Solo allí, con Andrea Bacci y Dario Marconcini como pasantes, “los actores Pavese”, con Marion Befve y Renato Berta junto a la cámara, efectuando el movimiento de esa última panorámica, bajo los sones del Das Lied von der Erde de Mahler, en un movimiento lento y silencioso para que no altere el trabajo de la naturaleza, para que se pueda registrar los sonidos que Danièle tanto amaba y le puedan ser entregados como ofrenda de hinojos por el micrófono de Jean-Pierre Duret. Qué complicado, imaginamos, para Nicole Lubtchansky sentarse a la moviola. Soñador por tocar la rodilla de Artemisa, escribe Pavese: «Igualmente conocido es que cuando uno no duerme quisiera dormir y que pasa a la historia como el eterno soñador». Straub sacó su última carta del bolsillo, sabiendo que solo junto a Pavese podría volver a encontrar sus huellas. Todo el pasaje habla, por medio del pasante, del reencuentro entre ellos. Por eso, cuando Straub lleva después la pieza a la sala del teatro toscano, vemos cómo aparece proyectado en una pantalla, al fondo del escenario, un rincón del bosque, vacío. Apenas unos troncos apilados al pie de un árbol, un banco para que Danièle descanse. A un mismo tiempo teatro, amor y cine. Es el colofón del soñador o, si queremos, la última voluntad. Devolverle de su parte el trabajo a los hombres, en su propio espacio. Recordemos siempre esa panorámica, buscando las huellas, y los cambios de luz: sístole y diástole… aún late.\nL'exercice a eté profitable, Madame", "url": "http://elumiere.net/exclusivo_web/internacional_straub/textos/genou_artemide.php"}

Trump names former editor of Breitbart news and his chief strategist Steve Bannon to the Principals Committee (PC) of the National Security Council (NSC),” one of the signs states before going on to assert that “Breitbart news is unfamous as a haven for white nationalists, neo-Nazis, and anti-semitists. Bannon himself has a record of anti-semitism (from his divorce proceedings), and islamophobia (from his infamous ‘why let them in?’ comments).”\n“Senate votes 51-50 confirming Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education with a tiebreaking vote from VP Mike Pence, the first ever,” declares another sign. “DeVos, a billionaire Republican donor and fundraiser with little experience in education, is a lifetime supporter of private and for-profit schools, and has a history of seeking to divert funds from vulnerable public schools” [emphasis in original].\nDan Cresci, a sophomore at Gettysburg College, told Campus Reform that he doesn’t believe the claims against Sessions and Bannon were a sufficient enough argument.\n“Their main claims against Sessions and Bannon weren’t about their qualifications, but only that they are ‘racists’ and ‘white nationalists,” he pointed out. “They claim all these things are racist just because they go against the GACC agenda.”\nAnother student took no stance on the box display, but emphasized that the campus library should be kept as an area for studying, not political controversy.\n[RELATED: VIDEO: Michigan students occupy library to protest Trump victory]\n“While I think exercising the right to free speech is imperative in a democracy, I feel as though the library is an inappropriate location for such demonstrations, regardless of my views on the sentiments expressed,” Guilia DiGuglielmo told Campus Reform. “The library should remain a quiet, inviting place where students can focus on their studies: the reason they are on this campus.”\nTwo students, however, while unaffiliated with the GACC, did express support for the display.\n“The wall is a way to show headlines and events that have happened since Trump was elected to students who might not be aware of their occurrence,” Zach Rhodes innocently described the exhibit. “It is important to have a physical record of some decisions the administration has made in a time where information moves in and out of consciousness quickly.”\nSimilarly, Claire Bickertold opined that “the Trump Wall is a good representation of the damage that he is doing to the country,” adding that “it allows us to remember how fast the country is deteriorating.”\n[RELATED: Clemson faculty sign up for anti-Trump protest group]\nJerome Clark, the current President of GACC at Gettysburg College, did not respond to Campus Reform’s request for comment, and it remains unclear how long the display will remain in the Musselman Library or whether the student group plans on updating it with further information about the Trump administration.\nFollow the author of this article on Twitter: @a_nlopez", "url": "http://www.campusreform.org/?ID=8786"}

{"text": "Yankees Cruise To 8th Straight Win Behind Homers From Holliday And Judge\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Jordan Montgomery took a shutout into the seventh inning for his first major league win, Matt Holliday homered in his return to the lineup and the New York Yankees romped to their eighth consecutive victory by beating the Chicago White Sox 7-4 on Monday night.\nHolliday put the Yankees ahead with a titanic three-run shot in a five-run third inning, and Aaron Judge added a two-run homer that chased Derek Holland (1-2) with the score 7-0 in the fifth. New York has rebounded from a 1-4 start with its longest winning streak since a 10-game run in June 2012.\nMaking his second career start, Montgomery (1-0) immediately found himself in a first-inning jam. But the 24-year-old lefty calmly pitched his way out of it by retiring cleanup hitter Jose Abreu and streaking Avisail Garcia with runners at second and third.\nGarcia began the night leading the majors with a .465 batting average.\nThe 6-foot-6 Montgomery scattered four hits over the first six innings, but never got another out. He gave up consecutive singles to start the seventh and then a three-run homer to Yolmer Sanchez that ended the pitcher’s night.\nMontgomery jogged off the mound to cheers, and Adam Warren took over. Warren worked into the ninth before Chicago cut it to 7-4 on Kevan Smith’s run-scoring double of the wall in right-center.\nAroldis Chapman came on and gave up a single that put runners at the corners, but the closer got Tyler Saladino to ground into a game-ending double play for his fourth save — the fourth double play turned by the Yankees.\nWarren retired 22 straight batters to begin the season before issuing a two-out walk to Saladino in the seventh.\nStarlin Castro had three hits for New York, and Judge drove in three runs. Castro and Chase Headley hit successive doubles after Holliday’s homer into the bleachers beyond the left-center bullpen, estimated at 459 feet. The veteran slugger missed the previous two games with lower back stiffness.\nJudge added a run-scoring infield single to complete the third-inning outburst for New York, which has won its first seven home games for the first time since 1998.\nHolland was tagged for seven runs — six earned — and 10 hits in 4 2/3 innings while falling to 1-7 against the Yankees.\nChicago, which had won four of five, dropped to 7-21 at the current Yankee Stadium.\nBIRD ON THE BENCH\nDespite breaking out of his slump Sunday night with a huge game at the plate, Yankees 1B Greg Bird was left on the bench in favor of Chris Carter. Still, manager Joe Girardi insisted the team views Bird as an everyday player. “Holland’s really tough on left-handers,” Girardi explained. “So we got as many righties as we could today.” LF Brett Gardner also was rested as Girardi stacked his lineup with eight right-handed hitters underneath leadoff man Jacoby Ellsbury. Bird struck out as a pinch hitter in the eighth.\nTRAINER’S ROOM\nWhite Sox: 3B Todd Frazier sat out his second consecutive game because of an illness manager Rick Renteria described as a “flu-like stomach irritation.” Renteria said Frazier was feeling better, though, and finally able to keep food down. Frazier has had a hard time shaking the bug, which caused him to miss two games last week. He returned Saturday but left that game early with recurring symptoms. … Bench coach Joe McEwing, known for his boundless enthusiasm, went to the mound to remove Holland in an animated pitching change. McEwing took on the task because Renteria was hobbled by knee inflammation.\nYankees: SS Didi Gregorius (right shoulder strain) could play in a simulated game in the next few days. He is expected to begin a minor league rehab assignment soon.\nON THE MOVE\nNew York traded Triple-A pitcher Johnny Barbato to the Pittsburgh Pirates for $150,000 or a player to be named. The right-hander made 13 major league relief appearances last year.\nUP NEXT\nRHP Luis Severino (1-0) looks to extend New York’s winning streak Tuesday night when he faces RHP Miguel Gonzalez (1-0) in the second game of the series. The 23-year-old Severino set a career high with 11 strikeouts last time out against Tampa Bay, ending a string of 13 winless starts that dated to a victory over the White Sox in September 2015.\n(© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Una vez reiniciadas las actividades, al día siguiente se presentaron Carabineros y militares para detener selectivamente a algunos obreros y empleados, en su mayoría, dirigentes sindicales.\nSegún el proceso judicial en curso, Gazmuri Plaza, junto al interventor militar Patricio Altamirano y el gerente, Gustavo Ross, retuvieron en la oficina de la Gerencia a José Davia, José Maldonado, Augusto Alcayaga, Guillermo Flores y a los hermanos Juan y Miguel Fernández Cuevas. Éstos salieron esposados del lugar y sus cuerpos fueron encontrados muertos repartidos en diferentes partes de la ciudad.\n“Permanentemente vemos que cómplices civiles de la dictadura viven en total impunidad, ocupando altos cargos del Gobierno en Chile y el exterior, o en el Congreso. Nosotros rechazamos la postulación de esta persona que fue cómplice del asesinato de seis trabajadores y que hoy, paradójicamente, viene a resguardar la salud de los mismos”, indicó Alicia Lira, presidenta de la AFEP.\nLira aclaró que aún no han hecho una petición formal al directorio, ya que quisieron primero comunicarlo a la opinión pública. Sin embargo, entregarán los antecedentes a la Comisión de Derechos Humanos del Senado y la Cámara de Diputados y a otros organismos pertinentes para evitar que Gazmuri ocupe el cargo.\nLos familiares indicaron que no está capacitado ética ni moralmente para ejercerlo, considerando que, además, podría ser llamado a declarar en la causa que Luis Zepeda, ministro de la Corte de Apelaciones de Santiago, lleva por el caso.\n“Hay un ánimo a nivel nacional, no sólo de la derecha, de ocultar a los cómplices civiles de la dictadura, así como de intentar su indulto y el de los militares presos. También hay un pacto de silencio, del Ejército y Carabineros, ya que nos han mentido en diversas ocasiones sobre el destino de los detenidos que no han aparecido”, denunció, añadiendo que este no es un problema de las víctimas y sus familias, sino que “tal como la crisis en la educación, es un problema país”.\nDon Víctor Hugo Fuentes es dirigente nacional de la AFEP. Padre del joven Oscar Fuentes Fernández -estudiante de segundo año de ingeniería civil en minas en la Universidad de Santiago, detenido por un auto de civil perteneciente a Carabineros en 1985, y baleado por la espalda en el centro de Santiago- hoy a sus 74 años continúa en la “lucha contra la impunidad”.\nSeñala haber conocido a uno de los dirigentes de Elecmetal asesinados y considera que la postulación a la presidencia de la ACHS de Gazmuri Plaza es una “falta de respeto no sólo a la memoria historia, sino a todos los chilenos”.", "url": "http://trincheradelaimagen.blogspot.com/2011/07/familiares-de-ejecutados-politicos.html"}

To resolve this issue, use a non-Win32 program to rename the file. You can use a POSIX tool or any other tool that uses the appropriate internal syntax to use the file.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, you may be able to use some built-in commands to bypass the typical Win32 reserved name checks if you use a particular syntax to specify the path of the file. For example, if you use the Del command in Windows XP, you can delete a file named \"lpt1\" if you specify the full path of the file by using the following special syntax:</p>\n\n<pre><code>del \\\\?\\c:\\path_to_file\\lpt1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For more information about deleting files with reserved names under Windows NT and Windows 2000, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/120716/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">120716</a> How to remove files with reserved names in Windows</p>\n\n<p>For more information about deleting files with reserved names under Windows XP, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315226/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">315226</a> How to remove files with reserved names in Windows XP</p>\n\n<p>If you open a handle to a file by using the typical Win32 CreateFile mechanism, certain file names are reserved for old-style DOS devices. For backward compatibility, these file names are not permitted and they cannot be created by using typical Win32 file calls. However, this issue is not a limitation of NTFS.</p>\n\n<p>You may be able to use a Win32 program to bypass the typical name checks that are performed when a file is created (or deleted) by using the same technique that you use to traverse folders that are deeper than MAX_PATH. Additionally, some POSIX tools are not subject to these name checks. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Cause 6:</strong> The file name includes an invalid name in the Win32 name space\nYou may not be able to delete a file if the file name includes an invalid name (for example, the file name has a trailing space or a trailing period or the file name is made up of a space only). To resolve this issue, use a tool that uses the appropriate internal syntax to delete the file. You can use the \"\\?\\\" syntax with some tools to operate on these files, for example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>del \"\\\\?\\c:\\path_to_file_that contains a trailing space.txt \"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The cause of this issue is similar to Cause 4. However, if you use typical Win32 syntax to open a file that has trailing spaces or trailing periods in its name, the trailing spaces or periods are stripped before the actual file is opened. Therefore, if you have two files in the same folder named \"AFile.txt\" and \"AFile.txt \" (note the space after the file name), if you try to open the second file by using standard Win32 calls, you open the first file instead. Similarly, if you have a file whose name is just \" \" (a space character) and you try to open it by using standard Win32 calls, you open the file's parent folder instead. In this situation, if you try to change security settings on these files, you either may not be able to do this or you may unexpectedly change the settings on different files. If this behavior occurs, you may think that you have permission to a file that actually has a restrictive ACL. </p>\n", "url": null}

{"text": "<p>I have a Quad Core Intel PC with 4GB of RAM - I've been using it over a year to run web server stress tests (ab.exe -n 5000 -c 500), encode HD video, play games, open dozens of tabs in multiple browsers (simultaneously), worked on multi-layered +8000px art in photoshop and just about every other thing you can think of.</p>\n\n<p>As of yet I've never passed 2.3GB of RAM usage. How in the world do you use all 4GB? <em>Is there any use for it?</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong>\nI started-up Photoshop with a 8000px (+350MB) PSD and another (+30MB) 5000px PSD. I already had Chrome running with almost a dozen tabs open. Then I started Firefox (with all my addon's) and opened another 10 or so tabs. Apache 2.2 is running to serve PHP files. Last I have a 700 song playlist playing in windows media player. I guess I could have started open office too - but I never use it.</p>\n\n<p>I guess I could just keep opening programs until I don't have any taskbar space left - but that would be an unrealistic example. I never run more than 5-7 apps at a time for my own sanity. </p>\n\n<p>What's your operating system? 32bit Windows XP only supports 2GB for applications. If you have 4GB the other half is allocated for the kernel.</p>\n\n<p>And btw, virtual machines are a great way to waste resources.</p>\n", "url": null}
{"text": "<p>I have a PC that's running Ubuntu 9.04 with the KDE desktop installed. I use it as a file/printer/IMAP server. Usually, I switch it on and then use some other computer to work on. After a few hours of just sitting around with just the login prompt on screen, the system panics - the scroll lock and caps lock keyboard lights flash.</p>\n\n<p>I'd like to fix this.</p>\n\n<p>However, being a linux noob, I have no idea where to start.</p>\n\n<p>So, the question is, what's the best way to diagnose the cause of the panic?</p>\n\n<p>I have googled a bit but often the solutions, if any, are vague. Ideally, the answer would end up being a flow chart of the steps needed to narrow down the cause of the panic.</p>\n\n<p><em>See my response below for further details and questions.</em></p>\n\n<p>Here's what I've done (feel free to make corrections to any suggestions below):</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update Software</strong></p>\n\n<p>I noticed in the console view mentioned below that there was a call to bitmap_weight just before the panic message. I looked on nVidia's website and found a new version of the video driver, so I downloaded and installed that. I also ran the update manager to update all the software on the machine. I'm still getting the panics but it seems to be longer between instances. I guess it is always advisable to make sure you've got all the latest updates. UPDATE: No, the panics haven't changed, even the Ctrl-Alt-F7 console displays the same messages (How do I get this written to a file?!).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.memtest.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Memtest86+ (link)</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>If it doesn't already appear, pressing 'esc' during the boot up sequence displays the grub menu. On this menu is an option to run Memtest86+. On Ubuntu 9.04 this is V2.11. There is a V4.00 available on their website. You will need to download the ISO CD image, burn a CD with it, restart the computer and boot from the CD. For my problem, the default tests didn't highlight any problems. Pressing 'c' displayed a configuration menu and here there is an additional test that can be performed - the bit-fade test. This one takes a long time to run (it is currently running as I type this). If this does highlight a problem, try replacing the memory chips and repeat the test. If it still fails then you probably need a new motherboard.</p>\n\n<p>Testing results: I checked the PC this morning and memtest was still running - 9 hours with no errors. It did confuse me at first since it was doing a bit fade test, the timer said 20 minutes. I thought it had rebooted, but in fact the timer is just the time since the start of the bit fade test. Swapping back to default tests causes the displayed time to show the total up-time. So it seems the memory is OK.</p>\n\n<p><strong>kexec-tools and console view</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have now installed kexec-tools although it is a complex beast so I don't think I'll get anything useful for now. In doing so, however, I came accross <a href=\"http://linux.about.com/od/linux101/l/blnewbie5_1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a page that lists some useful keyboard shortcuts</a>. At the login, I pressed Ctrl-Alt-F8 to display the console output. I left the machine running and it panicked - the console did display some messages, one of which was a panic message. Now, it would be really useful if this output had been saved to a file as it only had about 25 lines of message visible. Does anyone know where this file is or how to get it to save the output?</p>\n\n<p>So, in the X console (the Ctrl-Alt-F8 screen) one of the functions in the log was bitmap_weight, so I though it might be the video card.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Turning Off the Video</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the /etc folder are a set of folders called rc0.d, rc1.d, etc, and these contain a set of scripts used to set the system up. Normally, the scripts in rc2.d are executed when you turn the system on. In here, the script to start up the window manager are called S30gdm for Gnome and S30kdm for KDE. Rename these as K70gdm / K70kdm and reboot the system. You now have a text prompt login, the GUI is disabled. Doing this, the system was far more stable, it stayed alive all night, something it hadn't previously done. I have an nVidia video card, and checking their web site I saw that there has been an update to the video driver recently. I have now installed this and will see if the problem persists. I should point out here that I do keep the system fairly up to date with any recent updates and I think there was a kernel update which might have affected the old video driver. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, to restore the GUI, rename K70gdm and/or K70kdm back to S30gdm / S30kdm and reboot.</p>\n", "url": null}

{"text": "a past in which Jews, Muslims and Christians were all part of a thriving Arab culture.\nThey acknowledge the need to move Israel towards real democracy: \"We believe that, as Mizrahi Jews in Israel, our struggle for economic, social, and cultural rights rests on the understanding that political change cannot depend on the Western powers who have exploited our region and its residents for many generations. True change can only come from an intra-regional and inter-religious dialog that is in connection with the different struggles and movements currently active in the Arab world. Specifically, we must be in dialog and solidarity with struggles of the Palestinians citizens of Israel who are fighting for equal political and economic rights and for the termination of racist laws, and the struggle of the Palestinian people living under Israeli military occupation in the West Bank and in Gaza in their demand to end the occupation and to gain Palestinian national independence.\"\nHer/his place (or places) of origin follows each person's signature. This highlights the connection felt to places and cultures that the Zionist narrative has attempted to erase.\nWe, as the descendents of the Jewish communities of the Arab and Muslim world, the Middle East and the Maghreb, and as the second and third generation of Mizrahi Jews in Israel, are watching with great excitement and curiosity the major role that the men and women of our generation are playing so courageously in the demonstrations for freedom and change across the Arab world. We identify with you and are extremely hopeful for the future of the revolutions that have already succeeded in Tunisia and Egypt. We are equally pained and worried at the great loss of life in Libya, Bahrain, Yemen, Syria, and many other places in the region.\nOur generation's protest against repression and oppressive and abusive regimes, and its call for change, freedom, and the establishment of democratic governments that foster citizen participation in the political process, marks a dramatic moment in the history of the Middle East and North Africa, a region which has for generations been torn between various forces, internal and external, and whose leaders have often trampled the political, economic, and cultural rights of its citizens.\nWe are Israelis, the children and grandchildren of Jews who lived in the Middle East and North Africa for hundreds and thousands of years. Our forefathers and mothers contributed to the development of this region's culture, and were part and parcel of it. Thus the culture of the Islamic world and the multigenerational connection and identification with this region is an inseparable part of our own identity.\nWe are a part of the religious, cultural, and linguistic history of the Middle East and North Africa, although it seems that we are the forgotten children of its history: First in Israel, which imagines itself and its culture to be somewhere between continental Europe and North America. Then in the Arab world, which often accepts the dichotomy of Jews and Arabs and the imagined view of all Jews as Europeans, and has preferred to repress the history of the Arab-Jews as a minor or even nonexistent chapter in its history; and finally within the Mizrahi communities themselves, who in the wake of Western colonialism, Jewish nationalism and Arab nationalism, became ashamed of their past in the Arab world.\nConsequently we often tried to blend into the mainstream of society while erasing or minimizing our own past. The mutual influences and relationships between Jewish and Arab cultures were subjected to forceful attempts at erasure in recent generations, but evidence of them can still be found in many spheres of our lives, including music, prayer, language, and literature.\nWe wish to express our identification with and hopes for this stage of generational transition in the history of the Middle East and North Africa, and we hope that it will open the gates to freedom and justice and a fair distribution of the region's resources.\nWe turn to you, our generational peers in the Arab and Muslim world, striving for an honest dialog which will include us in the history and culture of the region. We looked enviously at the pictures from Tunisia and from Al-Tahrir square, admiring your ability to bring forth and organize a nonviolent civil resistance that has brought hundreds of thousands of people out into the streets and the squares, and finally forced your rulers to step down.\nWe, too, live in a regime that in reality—despite its pretensions to being \"enlightened\" and \"democratic\"—does not represent large sections of its actual population in the Occupied Territories and inside of the Green Line border(s). This regime tramples the economic and social rights of most of its citizens, is in an ongoing process of minimizing democratic liberties, and constructs racist barriers against Arab-Jews, the Arab people, and Arabic culture. Unlike the citizens of Tunisia and Egypt, we are still a long way from the capacity to build the kind of solidarity between various groups that we see in these countries, a solidarity movement that would allow us to unite and march together–all who reside here–into the public squares, to demand a civil regime that is culturally, socially, and economically just and inclusive.\nWe believe that, as Mizrahi Jews in Israel, our struggle for economic, social, and cultural rights rests on the understanding that political change cannot depend on the Western powers who have exploited our region and its residents for many generations. True change can only come from an intra-regional and inter-religious dialog that is in connection with the different struggles and movements currently active in the Arab world. Specifically, we must be in dialog and solidarity with struggles of the Palestinians citizens of Israel who are fighting for equal political and economic rights and for the termination of racist laws, and the struggle of the Palestinian people living under Israeli military occupation in the West Bank and in Gaza in their demand to end the occupation and to gain Palestinian national independence.\nIn our previous letter written following Obama's Cairo speech in 2009, we called for the rise of the democratic Middle Eastern identity and for our inclusion in such an identity. We now express the hope that our generation – throughout the Arab, Muslim, and Jewish world – will be a generation of renewed bridges that will leap over the walls and hostility created by previous generations and will renew the deep human dialog without which we cannot understand ourselves: between Jews, Sunnis, Shias, and Christians, between Kurds, Berbers, Turks, and Persians, between Mizrahis and Ashkenazis, and between Palestinians and Israelis. We draw on our shared past in order to look forward hopefully towards a shared future.\nWe have faith in intra-regional dialog—whose purpose is to repair and rehabilitate what was destroyed in recent generations—as a catalyst towards renewing the Andalusian model of Muslim-Jewish-Christian partnership, God willing, Insha'Allah, and as a pathway to a cultural and historical golden era for our countries. This golden era cannot come to pass without equal, democratic citizenship, equal distribution of resources, opportunities, and education, equality between women and men, and the acceptance of all people regardless of faith, race, status, gender, sexual orientation, or ethnic affiliation. All of these rights play equal parts in constructing the new society to which we aspire. We are committed to achieving these goals within a process of dialog between all of the people of Middle East and North Africa, as well as a dialog we will undertake with different Jewish communities in Israel and around the world.\nThe Israeli left rushed to the defense of Amos Oz, who only wanted Marwan Barghouti to understand \"our story\". But its acceptance of the \"our\" bit is the real problem here.\nThe eternal candidate for the Nobel Prize for Literature, Amos Oz, has created a storm in a teapot, by sending a copy of his book \"A Tale of Love and Darkness\" to imprisoned Palestinian leader Marwan Barghouti, with the dedication \"This story is our story, and I hope you read it and come to understand us better\". When the news of his \"bold, subversive\" act broke, there were those who protested Oz's planned participation at a gathering in honor of outstanding physicians at \"Assaf Harofe\" hospital, and the event was canceled as a result.\nLevy protests the persecution of Oz (\"witch hunt\"), and he is appalled precisely because Oz is a devout Zionist and a committed patriot. He recognizes the fact that Oz has never been a radical, and he even mentions the latter's shameful support for Operation Cast Lead. However, the only point which somehow eludes Levy's critical scrutiny is Oz's mere pretension – pompous, narcissistic, and megalomaniacal – to portray his book as \"our story\". OUR story. Whose exactly? I cannot speak for Levy, but my grandmother never beat her bed sheets every morning to shake off the Levant; members of my family never lived on streets that would eventually be named after them, and no, even our relation to this region has not been derived from the Holocaust trauma, and from the havoc it wrought on the souls of the survivors.\nThis is also the message conveyed to our Palestinian neighbors: if you wish to figure out what's going on here, whom you're dealing with, and who holds the keys to your case, you must study \"our story\". And this message, as it turns out, runs deep: \"A Tale of Love and Darkness\" was translated into Arabic thanks to the initiative and financial support of Adv. Elias Khouri, a dear man and a bereaved father who dedicated the project to the memory of his son, also with the belief that the book would constitute a key to the understanding of \"their story\"; an Arabic translation of a Hebrew book which cries out in Yiddish.", "url": "http://jewishpeacenews.blogspot.com/2011/04/young-mizrahi-israelis-open-letter-to.html"}

{"text": "Prestigious Conservation Award for Northwood Cemetery restoration\n\nThe Friends of Northwood Cemetery have been announced as winners of a prestigious Isle of Wight Society Conservation Award for 2018.\nThe award scheme is for the promotion of buildings and the environment on the Island. The society works with the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA, Isle of Wight). The aim is to encourage a high standard of planning, architecture, and the conservation of buildings and their setting on the Isle of Wight.\nEntries are judged mainly on their quality of design and the work overall and also the visual impact on the environment. With support from the council, the volunteer group restored the two chapels at Northwood Cemetery, Northwood, from near collapse, following the successful application for a Heritage Lottery Grant.\nHighlighting significant achievement and dedication\nCabinet member for environment and heritage, Cllr John Hobart, said,\n“This well-deserved Isle of Wight Society award highlights the significant achievement and dedication that the group has made in bringing back two dilapidated buildings for community use and the council has been proud to support them in this project. “The goal was to bring the buildings back into use via a newly created partnership with the council and the Friends of Northwood Cemetery uniquely taking on the responsibility of being the accountable body and with the aspiration of trialling a new approach to major project development and delivery on the Island – one that potentially could be replicated elsewhere. It has been a pleasure to have been involved.”\nFriends: Honoured to receive this award\nFriends of Northwood Cemetery chairman, Peter Almond, said:\n“This has been a ten year story of a small group of passionate volunteers who, with support from the council, managed to obtain significant funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund. “We are honoured to receive this award and it makes all those years of work – come rain, hail or shine – worth it. Now we are now able to offer wildlife and family history tours in this beautiful oasis of calm greenery in Northwood. We would still welcome new volunteers to join us as we continue the task of clearing undergrowth and bringing the grounds back to their natural beauty.”\nThe restoration\nThe West Chapel was derelict and the East Chapel was in poor condition, following severe ground movement and Second World War bomb damage. Reparation works undertaken were extensive and included fifty foot foundations installed on the West Chapel, which was in danger of collapse. Structural repairs were made to both buildings, such as intensive stonework repairs; new oak floors, insulation and inner skin, electrics and heating provided.\nIn addition, a new kitchen was built to the west building, using original stone from a previous structure that had been demolished years earlier. Both building are now back in use for the community, with funerals taking place in the East Chapel and research and history recording in the West Chapel, (now the Heritage Resource Centre).\nImage: © Barry-Sowerby\nLocation map\nView the location of this story.", "url": "https://onthewight.com/isle-of-wight-society-conservation-award-northwood-cemetery/"}

{"text": "The city’s first silent cinematic theatre is being dramatically transformed into just 10 unique and spacious apartments for sale in Lisbon, just off the emblematic Avenida da Liberdade.\nDating back to 1927 this iconic building, once revitalised, will offer a range of one to three bedroom apartments, each with generous sizes and clever interior design that maximises the use of space, light. As well as a brand new restaurant at the base of the renovated building, the development will also feature automated robotic parking.\nWhy is this building renovation so exciting?\nAside from the incredible prime location, over three years of painstaking work has gone into the planning and architectural design of this impressive restoration and redevelopment.\nWithin a building that has the space to occupy a great deal more apartments, the developer has chosen against maximising the space for residential means and instead, is creating a small handful of unique and iconic properties and one incredible restaurant, which will last forever as totally unique pieces of real estate history.\nHotels and boutiques are opening up near to this project including a slick 5* hotel, which will further benefit the area.\nWhat else about Avenida da Liberdade?\nOften compared to Paris' Champs Élysée, Avenida da Liberdade offers charming period architecture and baroque features, along with some of the world’s top shopping brands including Cartier, Chanel and Louis Vuitton.\nResidents can take advantage of numerous gourmet restaurants, including the new one arriving at this project and they will still be within walking distance from all of Lisbon's most emblematic areas; Chiado, Baixa, Alfama, Mouraria.", "url": "https://www.athenaadvisers.com/property/apartments-for-sale-avenida-da-liberdade-odeon/"}

{"text": "Lawmakers move to impeach Buhari for spending $496m on jets without approval\n\nLawmakers move to impeach Buhari for spending $496m on jets without approval\nSome members of the house of representatives have called for President Muhammadu Buhari’s impeachment for approving the withdrawal of sum of $496 million without their nod, TheCable reports.\nThis follows a letter which Buhari wrote to the house on Tuesday, defending his approval of the money used for the procurement of 12 Super Tucano aircraft from the US.\nThe money was said to have been withdrawn from the excess crude account (ECA).\nIn a letter written to the national assembly, Buhari said he had anticipated the lawmakers will approve the withdrawal.\nReading the contents of the letter during plenary on Monday, Yakubu Dogara, speaker of the house, quoted Buhari as saying: “In the expectation that the national assembly would have no objection to the purchase of this highly specialized aircraft, which is critical to national security, I granted anticipatory approval for the release of US$496,374,470.00.”\nHe said the letter was sent to the leadership of the national assembly on April 13 and was received by his (speaker’s) office on April 17.\nThe development angered the lawmakers who accused the president of “overriding” their powers.\nTheir deliberation on the matter followed a constitutional point of order raised by Kingsley Chinda, from Rivers state.\nCiting sections 80 and 81 of 1999 constitution, Chinda said the Nigerian law does not recognise anticipatory approval.\nHe condemned the approval, wondering what would happen if the lawmakers fail to approve the money.\n“There is nowhere in our law that talked about anticipatory approval. We cannot sit down and allow this to take place. It is an impeachable offence. There is no infraction that is worse than this. Let us not continue to sleep. I propose that we commence the impeachment of Mr President,” he said.\nSome other lawmakers who also contributed to the motion supported the impeachment move, accusing the president of seeking their approval through the backdoor.\nSunday Karimi from Kogi said the lawmakers should write the president and inform him he has breached the constitution and “he should be prepared to face the consequences.”\n“This is the time to tell the president that we were elected to serve the people,” he added.\nHowever, Emmanuel Orker-Jev, chairman of the house committee on rules and businesses, said going by the house rules, Buhari’s letter ought to be slated for second reading before the house could debate it.\nThereafter, Dogara said the matter would be slated for second reading on a date during which “we can decide on what to do”.\nDo you have something awesome to share with the world?

{"text": "<p>I want to watch a folder tree on a network server for changes. The files all have a specific extension. There are about 200 folders in the tree and about 1200 files with the extension I am watching.</p>\n\n<p>I can't write a service to run on the server (off-limits!) so the solution has to be local to the client. Timeliness is not particularly important. I can live with a minute or more delay in notifications. I am watching for Create, Delete, Rename and Changes.</p>\n\n<p>Would using the .NET System.IO.fileSystemWatcher create much of a load on the server? </p>\n\n<p>How about 10 separate watchers to cut down the number of folders/files being watched? (down to 200 from 700 folders, 1200 from 5500 files in total) More network traffic instead of less? My thoughts are a reshuffle on the server to put the watched files under 1 tree. I may not always have this option hence the team of watchers.</p>\n\n<p>I suppose the other solution is a periodic check if the FSW creates an undue load on the server, or if it doesn't work for a whole bunch of SysAdmin type reasons.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a better way to do this?</p>\n\n<p>From a server load point of view, using the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.filesystemwatcher\" rel=\"noreferrer\">IO.FileSystemWatcher</a> for remote change notifications in the scenario you describe is probably the most efficient method possible. It uses the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa364417.aspx\" rel=\"noreferrer\">FindFirstChangeNotification</a> and <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365465.aspx\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ReadDirectoryChangesW</a> Win32 API functions internally, which in turn communicate with the network redirector in an optimized way (assuming standard Windows networking: if a third-party redirector is used, and it doesn't support the required functionality, things won't work at all). The .NET wrapper also uses async I/O and everything, further assuring maximum efficiency.</p>\n\n<p>The only problem with this solution is that it's not very reliable. Other than having to deal with network connections going away temporarily (which isn't too much of a problem, since IO.FileSystemWatcher will fire an error event in this case which you can handle), the underlying mechanism has certain fundamental limitations. From the MSDN documentation  for the Win32 API functions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-readdirectorychangesw\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ReadDirectoryChangesW</a> fails with ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER when the buffer length is greater than 64 KB and the application is monitoring a directory over the network. This is due to a packet size limitation with the underlying file sharing protocols</p></li>\n<li><p>Notifications may not be returned when calling <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-findfirstchangenotificationw\" rel=\"noreferrer\">FindFirstChangeNotification</a> for a remote file system</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In other words: under high load (when you would need a large buffer) or, worse, under random unspecified circumstances, you may not get the notifications you expect. This is even an issue with local file system watchers, but it's much more of a problem over the network. <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57254/\">Another question here on SO</a> details the inherent reliability problems with the API in a bit more detail.</p>\n\n<p>When using file system watchers, your application should be able to deal with these limitations. For example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>If the files you're looking for have sequence numbers, store the last sequence number you got notified about, so you can look for 'gaps' on future notifications and process the files for which you didn't get notified;</p></li>\n<li><p>On receiving a notification, always do a full directory scan. This may sound really bad, but since the scan is event-driven, it's still much more efficient than dumb polling. Also, as long as you keep the total number of files in a single directory, as well as the number of directories to scan, under a thousand or so, the impact of this operation on performance should be pretty minimal anyway.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Setting up multiple listeners is something you should avoid as much as possible: if anything, this will make things even <i>less</i> reliable...</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, if you absolutely <i>have</i> to use file system watchers, things can work OK as long as you're aware of the limitations, and don't expect 1:1 notification for every file modified/created. </p>\n\n<p>So, if you have other options (essentially, having the process writing the files notify you in a non-file system based way: any regular RPC method will be an improvement...), those are definitely worth looking into from a reliability point of view.</p>\n", "url": null}

{"text": "As I have already mentioned, the functional blocks shown in Figure 3 relate very closely to, even though they are not necessarily identical with, the computer's physical components. The computer's physical components are normally known collectively as the hardware. Software is a term often used to refer to a computer program or a collection of computer programs which enable a computer to carry out its tasks. As the course progresses you will find out a great deal about computer hardware and software, including the processor and the programs it runs. You will generate some programs yourself and look at the operation of the processor to see how it executes the instructions within them. Through this you will gain an understanding of what form the data used by the processor and memory must take, and hence understand the role of the input and output subsystems.\nSo the electrical signals that travel along the computer bus, and hence to the output subsystems and from the input subsystems, are all binary signals. Unfortunately, the electrical signals produced by input devices or needed by output devices are not necessarily binary, or even digital. Hence an important task of the input and output subsystems is to transform between the binary signals on the computer bus and whatever signals are used by their particular input or output device.\nKeyboard, display, 500 GB hard drive, 6 GB DDR3 RAM, speakers, touchpad, SD reader.\nThe keyboard and mouse relate to input devices. The display and speakers relate to output devices.\nTo decide whether the 500 GB hard drive relates to the secondary memory, to the secondary memory subsystem or to the combination of both you need to make an intelligent guess about what those who wrote the advert meant. In this case I suspect they probably meant the combination of the two.\nThe 6 GB DDR3 RAM relates to main memory.\nThe SD reader relates to secondary memory.\nThe laptop shown in Figure 2 contains a sound card and a network card. What problem arises if you try to relate these two items to the functional blocks of Figure 3?\nThe problem is that a sound card is used for both input and output (it takes inputs from a microphone and delivers outputs to one or more speakers). The network card is also used for both input and output (it both sends signals to and receives signals from the telephone network). Therefore these items do not at first seem to fit neatly with Figure 3. But remember that the diagram is showing functionality. So you can relate the input functionality of the sound card to the ‘input subsystem’ item in Figure 3 (the microphone would be the input device), and the output functionality of the sound card to the ‘output subsystem’ (the speaker or speakers would be the output device). In the case of the network card, its input functionality relates to the ‘input device’ in Figure 3 and its output functionality to the ‘output device’.\nThe terms input-output device and input-output subsystem are sometimes used where items have both input and output functionality. Hence a sound card is an input-output subsystem.\nFinally, just as you are just becoming familiar with all of the terms I have been introducing, I need to add a word of caution. When you read books or other literature about computers you may find some of the terms I have defined used differently. This is not necessarily a problem, and is common when technical terms become part of everyday language. However, throughout your study of this unit you do need to make sure that you use the terms as defined here.\nOne term I have not used here that you might come across is computer system. Historically some people used the terms ‘computer’ and ‘computer system’ rather differently. But that is no longer the case, and nowadays the word ‘system’ tends to be omitted.

Another $33 billion in six-month bills was auctioned at a discount rate of 0.945 percent, down from 0.950 percent last week. The rates last week were the highest in more than eight years.\nThe discount rates reflect that the bills sell for less than face value. For a $10,000 bill, the three-month price was $9,979.27, while a six-month bill sold for $9,952.23. That would equal an annualized rate of 0.833 percent for the three-month bills and 0.963 percent for the six-month bills.\nSeparately, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the average yield for one-year Treasury bills, a popular index for making changes in adjustable-rate mortgages, fell to 1.03 percent Thursday from 1.07 percent at the beginning of the week on April 10.", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/rates-us-treasury-bills-slip-year-high-46849963"}

{"text": "Q&A: How would GOP repeal health care law?\n\nFILE - In this Oct. 24, 2016 file photo, the HealthCare.gov 2017 website home page is seen in Washington. On its very first day, the new Congress plans to take initial steps toward repealing President Barack Obama's health care law. That would accomplish two things: Showing GOP stalwarts they're serious about shipping repeal legislation to new President Donald Trump, and postponing divisive decisions about how to replace Obama's law and cover some 20 million Americans until later. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File)\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The stakes confronting Republicans determined to dismantle President Barack Obama's health care law were evident in one recent encounter between an Ohio congressman and a constituent.\n\"He said, 'Now you guys own it. Now fix it. It's on your watch now,'\" recalled GOP Rep. Pat Tiberi, chairman of a pivotal health subcommittee. \"And this is a supporter.\"\nRepublicans have unanimously opposed Obama's law since Democrats muscled it through Congress in 2010. They've tried derailing it scores of times but have failed, stymied by internal divisions and Obama's veto power.\nWith the Republicans controlling Congress and Donald Trump entering the White House on Jan. 20, their mantra of repeal and replace is now a top-tier goal that the party's voters fully expect them to achieve — starting this week.\nBut by unwinding the statute, the GOP would kill or recast programs that provide coverage to 20 million Americans who will be wary of anyone threatening their health insurance. And continuing Republican rifts over how to reshape the law, pay for the replacement and avoid destabilizing health insurance markets mean party leaders have a bumpy path ahead.\n___\nQ: What's first?\nA: When the new Congress convenes Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said his chamber will begin debating a bare bones budget for next year. Most significantly, that would trigger a special procedure letting Republicans repeal much of Obama's law by a simple Senate majority.\nThat's big because GOP senators will have only a 52-48 edge. The debate will also be a way for Republicans to signal quickly to voters that they're starting to erase the law, even as they save actually doing it for later.\n___\nQ: And then?\nA: Lawmakers will work on legislation actually repealing much of Obama's law.\nThe legislation is likely to erase the mandate that people buy insurance or face hefty IRS fines, which Republicans despise. Also facing elimination or reductions: taxes Obama imposed on upper-income people to finance the law, subsidies that help millions afford health care and the expansion of Medicaid health coverage to more lower-earning people. Federal aid to Planned Parenthood would be halted, reflecting GOP opposition to the right to abortion, one of the women's health services provided by the organization.\nThey hope to pass the bill by late spring, but its provisions probably won't take effect for up to four years to give lawmakers time to craft a replacement.\nThis won't be easy. Many congressional Republicans are from states like Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania that have added about 10 million people to Medicaid and will oppose abandoning so many voters. Others will be nervous about voting to repeal the overall law without having replacement legislation to show constituents.\nRepublicans also worry that during the transition to a new system, health insurers — already struggling in some states — might protect themselves by leaving some markets and boosting premiums. To ease that, GOP aides say they're considering including some kind of stabilization fund in the repeal bill to protect insurers against losses. That remains a work in progress.\n___\nQ: Will the 20 million people now covered lose their benefits?\nA: Some probably will, a byproduct of reducing Medicaid coverage and dropping the requirement that individuals buy insurance.\nThat could be partly offset by some who'd purchase less expensive policies because the bill will probably let insurers drop coverage for some of the 10 services they now must provide, such as outpatient care and pregnancies.\nAt a briefing for reporters, top House GOP aides said the goal is \"universal access\" to health benefits, as opposed to aiming for coverage of all Americans. They said Obama's law ended up with many policies that are too expensive and offer limited access to doctors, but the shift in focus to \"access\" suggests Republicans don't want to be measured by the number of people actually covered.\nThe Senate's new minority leader, Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said recently that repealing Obama's law without a replacement would mean \"huge calamity from one end of America to the other.\"\nHouse Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, called claims that 20 million people will lose coverage a \"big lie.\" He said Republicans will provide \"an adequate transition period to give people piece of mind.\"", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/q-gop-repeal-health-care-law-082438243.html?ref=gs"}

Roger Ailes, the network’s founding chairman, received a $40 million package when he left, and Bill O’Reilly, the former top-rated host, received a payout of about $25 million.\nIn the filing, the company said it had $224 million in costs during the fiscal year related to “management and employee transitions and restructuring” at several of its business units, including the cable network group that houses Fox News.\nThe $50 million settlement figure disclosed Monday is $5 million more than what had been reported earlier. In May, the company disclosed that in the nine months leading up to March 31, it had incurred $45 million in costs tied to litigation related to harassment allegations.\nPhoto\nThe company has spent the past year trying to clean up the sexual harassment and discrimination scandal that has engulfed its Fox News division. Since the former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson filed suit last July against Mr. Ailes, the company has overhauled its management team, hired a new head of human resources, urged employees to report inappropriate behavior and conducted training sessions. In the wake of the scandal, Mr. Ailes, Mr. O’Reilly and several other employees were ousted.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/14/business/media/fox-harassment-settlements-cost.html?partner=rss&emc=rss"}

{"text": "Vive como empresario en Estados Unidos | EL EMPRESARIO\nInicio Vive como empresario en Estados Unidos Escrito por Angélica Pineda el 29 Nov 2016 Gustavo Galvez es bróker owner de PFS Realty. Foto EE: Natalia Gaia\nHace casi 22 años, México forma parte de los llamados Treaty Countries con los que Estados Unidos firmó convenios para fomentar el comercio extranjero en ese país, a través de las visas de inversionistas E1, E2 y EB 5, que permiten a empresarios y sus familias radicar en ese país invirtiendo por lo menos 100,000 dólares (tres millones de pesos), en una empresa estadounidense, que genere nuevos empleos. Gustavo Galvez es bróker owner de PFS Realty, una consultora de compra y venta de inmuebles residenciales y para comercios en sede en Miami y con oficinas en Colombia, Argentina y Ciudad de México. Fundó la empresa hace 14 años y a la fecha ha atendido a más de 3,000 clientes con un servicio integral que incluye conseguir la propiedad y obtener con la visa de turista un préstamo hipotecario hasta por 70% del valor del inmueble, a tasas de 4.5 a 5% anual y plazos por 30 años. “Conseguimos al inquilino, administramos la propiedad, la cobranza, la parte contable, legal, jurídica. Tenemos abogados de inmigración, es una firma con más de 100 años de existencia, que da a nuestros clientes la asesoría de cómo vivir o invertir en Estados Unidos”, agrega en entrevista el experto de origen colombiano. Miami, afirma, se ha convertido en un imán para las inversiones. Un estudio de Knight Frank coloca a esa ciudad como la sexta más atractiva del mundo para individuos con alto valor patrimonial. De acuerdo con datos del gobierno, el ingreso per cápita en La Florida es de 27,697 dólares y el ingreso familiar promedio asciende a 59,339 dólares. Como muchos colombianos, Gustavo Galvez salió de su país huyendo de la inseguridad y buscando una mejor calidad de vida. Llegó a Miami en agosto de 2001, días antes de los atentados contra las Torres Gemelas, el 11 de septiembre de ese año. La ciudad no era tan atractiva en ese entonces. Fue a raíz de la crisis inmobiliaria, que comenzó a modernizarse: construyó mejor infraestructura, hoteles, pronto comenzaron a llegar arquitectos de fama mundial, quienes vieron una oportunidad en una ciudad que ofrecía sol, buena ubicación y precios económicos por metro cuadrado de superficie. Galvez asegura que el metro cuadrado al sur de La Florida está en 2,000 dólares, contra los 3,000 o 4,000 que cuenta en Bogotá o Buenos Aires. También llegaron los artistas y los eventos de entretenimiento, como el boat show, lo que atrajo a los multimillonarios. México, asegura el bróker inmobiliario, figura entre los cuatro principales inversionistas de Estados Unidos a nivel nacional y es el octavo en Miami, detrás de Venezuela, Colombia, Brasil, Canadá y otros países europeos. El inversionista mexicano, considera Gustavo Gálvez, busca seguridad, un común denominador con el resto de los países de América Latina. “Muchos son pequeños empresarios que han trabajado muy duro y que no quieren perder lo que han construido, no sólo por las políticas de gobierno, tributarias, sino por los atracos, la inseguridad. Están cansado de eso y quieren un mejor sitio donde puedan tener mejor calidad de vida… y eso está pasando en Venezuela, Brasil, Ecuador y la ciudad de México”. Al inversionista, asevera, poco la importa la situación con Donald Trum. “Ya lo tiene claro, quiere colocar su dinero fuera y abrir oportunidades de mercado y llevarse a sus hijos a estudiar a Estados Unidos… Lo que va a venir con Trump es una linda oportunidad, porque el nuevo presidente es una persona que hizo su fortuna en la industria inmobiliaria ¿dónde crees que va a fortalecer su negocio? Franquicia o proyecto\nPara abrir una franquicia en Estados Unidos se requieren 100,000 dólares, lo que incluye derechos y puesta en operación. La visa E2 permite al inversionista y su familia vivir y trabajar y a los hijos menores de 21 años estudiar. Gustavo Galvez asegura que la visa de inversionista es la forma más rápida para llegar al Green Card (tarjeta de residencia permanente). Como en toda franquicia, la tasa de fracaso es baja. PSF cuenta con expertos en estudios de mercado quienes ayudan en la puesta en marcha del negocio. “Yo creo que el éxito está en dejarse asesorar. Siempre le dijo a la gente que si quiere ser exitosa se deje asesorar, porque así se ahorran tiempo y dinero para lograr el éxito que están buscando”. En cuanto a la EB 5, se trata de un programa creado por Estados Unidos en 1990 para promover el empleo y la inversión. Del 2008 al 2016 se ha generado 15.4 billones de dólares de inversión por esta vía y se crearon 29,358 empleos anuales entre 2010 y 2013. Los mexicanos con la EB 5 ha aportado 6.3% del total de inversión extranjera, en 2014 se concedieron 35 nuevas vías a mexicanos. Cuando una persona llega a PSF, la agencia lo dirige con la firma de abogados de migración, quienes le explicarán el funcionamiento de la EB 5, a estos deberá demostrar la procedencia lícita de los 500,000 dólares de inversión. El 97% de los casos son aprobados luego del due diligence.\nEl siguiente paso es escoger el proyecto de inversión, que puede ser un hotel u otro proyecto inmobiliario. Los inversionistas de América Latina, indica el entrevistado, buscan proyectos en la industria de la construcción, restaurantes y otros servicios, dada la privilegiada ubicación de la ciudad. Una vez tomada la decisión se depositan en un fideicomiso los 500,000 dólares. Pasarán dos años para obtener una respuesta, debido a la cantidad de gente que aplica para el programa. Según datos del portal eb5investors.mx, en 2005 se recibieron 332 solicitudes por la EB 5, y para el 2011 la cifra creció más de 10 veces. Hasta 2012, el gobierno había recibido 12,410 peticiones de visa. Mientras tanto el inversionista puede hacer uso de su visa de turista o tramitar la E2, que demoran menos tiempo. Una vez que la EB 5 es aprobado se entrega una residencia temporal, también se debe demostrar que el proyecto ha generado 10 nuevos empleos. A los cinco años, el empresario recibe el capital invertido. Finalmente, Gustavo Galvez destaca las oportunidades en tiempos de incertidumbre. “Yo lo llamo un ajuste del mercado, por el Brexit, Brasil que sacó a su presidente, las elecciones, la devaluación de las monedas, antes el mercado está aguantado. Pero en ciertas áreas de Miami, como Brickell o Downtown ha crecido mucho y los precios han caído entre 7 y 10% lo que es una oportunidad para el comprador, porque está adquiriendo inmuebles a precios de hace cinco años”. angelica.pineda@eleconomista.mx", "url": "http://elempresario.mx/actualidad/inversionista-medio-vivir-como-empresario-eu"}

{"text": "At French Open, Osaka balances tennis and PlayStation\n\nPARIS — Rattling through the first two rounds of the French Open without losing a set leaves more time for PlayStation for Naomi Osaka.\nAnd should the next big thing in Japanese tennis turn up late for her next match, it could well be because she lost track of time plugged into her console. Who needs the sights of Paris when you have \"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim\" to distract you? (\"It's OK you don't know it,\" she kindly told a middle-aged journalist).\n\"It's sort of consumed my time a little bit,\" the 20-year-old Osaka said Wednesday after reaching the third round at Roland Garros. \"Literally, if I have 30 minutes then I'll just sit there and I might be a little bit late. Like I'll spend 35 minutes and then I'm like, 'Oh my God, it's 30 minutes past,' and then I have to rush out the door. So if I'm ever late to anything, you know why.\"\nThe French Open marks the first time Osaka has been seeded at a major (at No. 21). That billing and her debut title on tour earlier this year, when she tore through a high-powered field to win at Indian Wells, mark out Japan's top-ranked woman as a player to watch in this first week when many struggle to find their feet on the red clay of Paris but others make it their home.\nOsaka, who also reached the third round at her first French Open in 2016 only to lose to a qualifier in straight sets in the first round last year, said she is concentrating less on the surface than on trying to win her first Grand Slam.\n\"In my mind, it's not really clay,\" she said. \"I just focus more on the tennis part, rather than making up excuses of what the surface is and how my play style isn't suited for it.\"\nOsaka's third-round opponent is Madison Keys, an American seeded 13th. Keys beat Osaka in both of their previous matches. If Osaka has her way, next time will not only produce a different outcome but be quick, too — because she hopes to spend as little time as possible on the tournament grounds.\n\"I'm only here if I have to be, to be honest,\" she said. \"When I was younger I used to love walking around and just experiencing the atmosphere. But now, like, I just sort of think of this as my job. So it's like clocking in and clocking out.\"\nThose she beat on her way to the Indian Wells title in March included five-time major winner Maria Sharapova and top-ranked Simona Halep. At her next tournament, in Miami, she then overpowered Serena Williams, her tennis idol in childhood, 6-3, 6-2 in the first round.\nShe started travelling with her games console from that point on.", "url": "https://www.parrysound.com/sports-story/8639608-at-french-open-osaka-balances-tennis-and-playstation/"}

Better to write something on the server side, if you have control of the app server, and use XML or some other data exchange method to get the data out to the applet.

Der \"Kaiser\" sieht Ballack \"am Lebensabend angekommen, fußballerisch gesehen\".\nThemen: Abschiedsspiel, Bayer Leverkusen, Franz Beckenbauer, Joachim Löw, Karriereende, Michael Ballack, Nationalmannschaft, USA\nBeckenbauer sieht zwar Ballacks Karriere in Deutschland auf der Zielgeraden, hält allerdings ein Engagement des Mittelfeldspielers in den USA für möglich, wie er in einem Interview mit der Zeitschrift „Bunte“ äußert. Der ehemalige Kapitän der deutschen Nationalmannschaft hatte zuletzt eher neben dem Platz als darauf für Schlagzeilen gesorgt, als er den Streit um ein Abschiedsspiel in der Nationalelf mit Trainer Joachim Löw öffentlich über Wochen austrug. Die Auseinandersetzung hatte an seinem Image gekratzt. Michael Ballack hat 98 Länderspiele für Deutschland absolviert.\nAbschiedsspiel-Streit mit Joachim Löw\nMitte Juni hatte er über seinen Berater Michael Becker die Erklärung verbreiten lassen, er habe erst „im Urlaub durch eine Pressemitteilung des DFB erfahren, dass der Bundestrainer nicht mehr mit mir plant. Form und Inhalt der Nachricht überraschen und enttäuschen mich zugleich, weil sie die vom Bundestrainer mir gegenüber gemachten Aussagen in keinster Weise widerspiegeln. Form und Inhalt der Mitteilung sind leider bezeichnend dafür, wie sich der Bundestrainer mir gegenüber seit meiner schweren Verletzung im Sommer letzten Jahres verhalten hat. Wenn jetzt so getan wird, als sei man mit mir und meiner Rolle als Kapitän der Deutschen Fußball-Nationalmannschaft jederzeit offen und ehrlich umgegangen, ist das an Scheinheiligkeit nicht zu überbieten. Und ein längst vereinbartes Freundschaftsspiel jetzt als Abschied zu deklarieren, ist aus meiner Sicht eine Farce. Ich weiß, dass ich meinen Fans dieses Spiel eigentlich schuldig bin, aber ich kann dieses ‚Angebot‘ nicht annehmen.“\nBankdrücker bei Bayer Leverkusen\nIn der Bundesliga hatte er zudem in der Vergangenheit häufiger auf der Bank von Bayer Leverkusen Platz nehmen müssen.

{"text": "Linda and I had planned to visit Louisville for her Mom's birthday on the weekend of March 12. Since we would be running anyway Linda thought a “group” run in Louisville would be nice. As it turned out the group she chose numbered 7953 plus the two of us, and it had a name: “Rodes City Run 10k” (www.rodescityrun.com).\nThis race is ranked the 13th largest 10k in the nation according to the 2009 USATF rankings and it was bigger than any event I had ever participated in. No big deal for Linda who has run 20+ marathons including Chicago and Boston. We are definitely not in 10k race shape as we are doing a slow progression in training for Chicago in October. With this in mind we decided the proper “mind set” was to take “Rodes City” as low-key tempo run. A non-conversational pace but definitely not “race” pace. Though technically a race, we would be in a mob of people that we didn’t know so we both found this to be a realistic endeavor. No familiar age group faces, no King/Queen competition, just get in a rhythm, run fast, stay relaxed and enjoy the atmosphere.\nTo help avoid slipping into the race day mind set we dressed in our typical daily run attire. We skipped any pre-race warm up, strides or stretching. Well, actually we had a semi-warm up – a jog to the port-a-johns and back to the start area. Not much of a warm up as the port-a-john lines were long and the temperature was a cool 45°, so any real warm up occurred after the run began.\nThe start area was sardine style – packed!! Announcements were made but I couldn’t hear anything but crowd noise. I did hear a start horn and then a minute or so later I began to move/walk with the flow of the crowd toward the start – thankfully chip timing was being used. Once across the start mat it was still a half-mile later before I felt like I had my own semblance of running space. I was able to establish a nice “not too fast, not too slow” rhythm and settled in to enjoy the opportunity. New ups, new downs, and new turns, a new experience and Linda and I both had fun!! Shortly after I finished Linda came in and we headed to the Panera tent for a bagel. Our times exceeded expectations without ever getting into the race mode – so we were pleased.\nThe course was point to point so after a jog cool down back to the car our “Rode” fun run adventure in Louisville was concluded.\nNext up is Mark Skelton’s Phipps Bend 10 miler. Another fun run and as Mark says, there is only ONE hill. We hope to see you there!!\nsmile often, speak gently, be kind.\nNortheast Tennessee native Tom Murrell coached track and cross-country for Tennessee High School and King College for too many years to mention.

{"text": "I didn’t think that I will live to see a time when jollof rice would dominate and become the people’s choice.\nBack in the day when all was good and fine, fried rice was a celebrated dish – much more celebrated than jollof rice. And because of the carefulness, skill and time that goes into its preparation, fried rice was a ceremonial meal in most homes. Many of us didn’t have fried rice everyday. It was considered a luxury.\nThose times, at the mention of fried rice, your eyeballs would pop out from their sockets, your brain would do somersaults in your head, your taste buds automatically get activated like, jollof who? Move over! Fried rice was the real deal few years back.\nToday, Jollof rice seems like the best thing on everybody’s food menu; simply because of the modifications and updating carried out to improve it’s quality. Sadly, as jollof evolved, fried rice was gradually devalued.\nThis happened – Nigerian cooks devised a cheap way of making fried rice. Fraudulent practices such as emptying containers of curry powder into their pots of rice became the order of the day.\nNow, what you’re served in most restaurants and at events is a plate of chaff-like, bland, green-yellow grains of rice. These days any rice coloured ‘green’ could pass for fried rice. Tueh!\nWorse still, lately, the chunks of carrots and peas you find in fried rice are now countable and sparsely distributed in this food; that’s if you’re lucky to find any. And then restaurants would slap a heavy price tag on it. Of course, they have served you the almighty ‘fried rice’.\nSincerely, I feel bad for the millennial generation. You people may never get to know what the real fried rice tastes like. Poor things. You may not be fortunate to enjoy that richly-garnished, colourfully decorated fried rice that made some moments of our lives memorable. Those days are gone and we may never get them back.\nChild, those plates of spicy, curried cereals you buy at overrated fast food restaurants and cafeterias in your campuses can not be classed as fried rice! Not even close! What they serve you there is the worst thing that happened to fried rice.\nWho remembers the good old days? Let’s reminisce in the comments section.\nlol, really? I’d need to have a taste of this ‘sister’s’ fried rice to judge myself.\nI’m sorry but just had to point out that this sounds so wrong….\nLmaoo this comment. E say na taste your sister’s fried rice.\nI read this and was laughing! Especially at curried cereals!\nFried rice may have reduced due to the time it consumes in preparation, but I don’t think fried rice will ever go into extinction.\nAbi! Let’s hope it doesn’t. That’s why we have cooks like you Julianah. Thank you.\nSo true my dear, even d taste is horrible,i think maybe cuz of d time dey put in preparing fried rice.\nHmm. I guess so too. Thank you.\nFried rice is still a luxury in some homes not because many people can’t cook it well, but because of how expensive the ingredients have become. Even to buy some cups of rice is now very expensive. What about concoction rice? I love that too. You can write about it too.\nWhat makes me sick is their ridiculous attempt at making fried rice at occasions as if it is by force. Give me Jolley rice if you don’t have the time to prepare fried rice. Nice write up.\nWrite a response…I agree with this write up. The way that name” fried rice” has been abused by naming coloured rice after it is incredible. it’s so laughable when some go ahead to sprinkle green beans and kidney beans on the dry rice and ask you” do you want fried rice or jollof rice”? Abeg join the crusade to “bring back our original fried rice”.\nyes! Mr Biggs fried rice used to be so good with slices of sausages in it.\nchai! I can almost taste it.\nfried rice became extinct in my house cos of Nepa.\nIt spoils too quickly abeg.\nI cannot come and come and cry after all my hardwork.\nBut I have a friend who makes the best fried rice and as a family tradition, its only cooked on birthdays. So I made it a point of duty to know all the birthdays of her parents and siblings so I never miss it!\nI still cook it the traditional way.

{"text": "Blood libel\n\nBlood libel or ritual murder libel (also blood accusation) is an antisemitic canard which falsely accuses Jews of murdering Christian boys in order to use their blood in the performance of religious rituals. Echoing very old myths of secret cultic practices in many prehistoric societies, the claim, as it is leveled against Jews, was rarely attested to in antiquity. According to Tertullian, it originally emerged in late antiquity as an accusation made against members of the early Christian community of the Roman Empire. Once this accusation had been dismissed, it was revived a millennium later as a Christian slander against Jews in the medieval period. This libel, alongside those of well poisoning and host desecration, became a major theme of the persecution of Jews in Europe from that period down to modern times.\n\nBlood libels often claim that Jews require human blood for the baking of matzos, an unleavened flatbread which is eaten during Passover. Earlier versions of the blood libel accused Jews of ritually re-enacting the crucifixion. The accusations often assert that the blood of Christian children is especially coveted, and historically, blood libel claims have been made in order to account for the otherwise unexplained deaths of children. In some cases, the alleged victims of human sacrifice have become venerated as Christian martyrs. Three of these William of Norwich, Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln, and Simon of Trent became objects of local cults and veneration; and although he was never canonized, the veneration of Simon was added to the General Roman Calendar. One child who was allegedly murdered by Jews, Gabriel of Białystok, was canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nIn Jewish lore, blood libels served as the impetus for the creation of the Golem of Prague by Rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel in the 16th century. According to Walter Laqueur:\n\nThe term 'blood libel' has also been used in reference to any unpleasant or damaging false accusation, and as a result, it has acquired a broader metaphoric meaning. However, this wider usage of the term remains controversial, because Jewish groups object to it.\n\nHistory\nThe earliest versions of the accusations involving Jews supposedly crucifying Christian children on Easter/Passover is said to be because of a prophecy. There is no reference to the use of blood in unleavened matzo bread at this time yet, which develops later as a major motivation for the crime.\n\nPossible precursors\nThe earliest known antecedent is from a man named Democritus (not the philosopher) mentioned in the Suda, who alleged that \"every seven years the Jews captured a stranger, brought him to the temple in Jerusalem, and sacrificed him, cutting his flesh into bits.\" The Greco-Egyptian author Apion claimed that the Jews sacrificed Greek victims in their temple. Here, the writer states that when Antiochus Epiphanes entered the temple in Jerusalem, he discovered a Greek captive, who told him that he was being fattened for sacrifice. Every year, Apion claimed, the Jews would sacrifice a Greek and consume his flesh, at the same time swearing eternal hatred towards the Greeks. Apion's claim likely reflects already circulating attitudes towards Jews as similar claims are made by Posidonius and Apollonius Molon in the 1st century BCE. This idea is exampled later in history, when Socrates Scholasticus ( 5th century) reported that in a drunken frolic, a group of Jews bound a Christian child to a cross in mockery of the death of Christ and scourged him until he died.\n\nIsrael Yuval proposed that the blood libel may have originated in the 12th century due to Christian views on Jewish behavior during the First Crusade. Some Jews committed suicide and killed their own children rather than exposing them to forced conversion to Christianity. Yuval wrote that Christians may have argued that if Jews could kill their own children, they could also kill Christian children.\n\nOrigins in England\n\nIn England in 1144, the Jews of Norwich were falsely accused of ritual murder after a boy, William of Norwich, was found dead in the woods with stab wounds. William's hagiographer, Thomas of Monmouth, falsely claimed that every year there is an international council of Jews at which they choose the country in which a child will be killed during Easter, because of a Jewish prophecy that states that the killing of a Christian child each year will ensure that the Jews will be restored to the Holy Land. According to Monmouth, England was chosen in 1144, and the leaders of the Jewish community delegated the Jews of Norwich to perform the killing, after which they abducted and crucified William. The legend was turned into a cult, with William acquiring the status of a martyr and pilgrims bringing offerings to the local church.\n\nThis was followed by similar accusations in Gloucester (1168), Bury St Edmunds (1181) and Bristol (1183). In 1189, the Jewish deputation attending the coronation of Richard the Lionheart was attacked by the crowd. Massacres of Jews at London and York soon followed. In 1190 on 16 March 150 Jews were attacked in York and then massacred when they took refuge in the royal castle, where Clifford's Tower now stands, with some committing suicide rather than being taken by the mob. The remains of 17 bodies thrown in a well in Norwich between the 12th and 13th century (five that were shown by DNA testing to likely be members of a single Jewish family) were very possibly killed as part of one of these pogroms.\n\nAfter the death of Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln, there were trials and executions of Jews. The case is mentioned by Matthew Paris and Chaucer, and thus has become well-known. Its notoriety sprang from the intervention of the Crown, the first time an accusation of ritual killing had been given royal credibility.\n\nThe eight-year-old Hugh disappeared at Lincoln on 31 July 1255. His body was probably discovered on 29 August, in a well. A Jew named Copin or Koppin confessed to involvement. He confessed to John of Lexington, a servant of the crown, and relative of the Bishop of Lincoln. He confessed that the boy had been crucified by the Jews, who had assembled at Lincoln for that purpose. King Henry III, who had reached Lincoln at the beginning of October, had Copin executed and 91 of the Jews of Lincoln seized and sent up to London, where 18 of them were executed. The rest were pardoned at the intercession of the Franciscans or Dominicans. Within a few decades, Jews would be expelled from all of England in 1290 and not allowed to return until 1657.\n\nContinental Europe\n\nMuch like the blood libel of England, the history of blood libel in continental Europe consists of unsubstantiated claims made about the corpses of Christian children. There were frequently associated supernatural events speculated about these discoveries and corpses, events which were often attributed by contemporaries to miracles. Also, just as in England, these accusations in continental Europe typically resulted in the execution of numerous Jews – sometimes even all, or close to all, the Jews in one town. These accusations and their effects also, in some cases, led to royal interference on behalf of the Jews.\n\nThomas of Monmouth's story of the annual Jewish meeting to decide which local community would kill a Christian child also quickly spread to the continent. An early version appears in Bonum Universale de Apibus ii. 29, § 23, by Thomas of Cantimpré (a monastery near Cambray). Thomas wrote, in around 1260, \"It is quite certain that the Jews of every province annually decide by lot which congregation or city is to send Christian blood to the other congregations.\" Thomas of Cantimpré also believed that since the time when the Jews called out to Pontius Pilate, \"His blood be on us, and on our children\" (), they have been afflicted with hemorrhages, a condition equated with male menstruation:\n\nA very learned Jew, who in our day has been converted to the (Christian) faith, informs us that one enjoying the reputation of a prophet among them, toward the close of his life, made the following prediction: 'Be assured that relief from this secret ailment, to which you are exposed, can only be obtained through Christian blood (\"solo sanguine Christiano\").' This suggestion was followed by the ever-blind and impious Jews, who instituted the custom of annually shedding Christian blood in every province, in order that they might recover from their malady.\n\nThomas added that the Jews had misunderstood the words of their prophet, who by his expression \"solo sanguine Christiano\" had meant not the blood of any Christian, but that of Jesus the only true remedy for all physical and spiritual suffering. Thomas did not mention the name of the \"very learned\" proselyte, but it may have been Nicholas Donin of La Rochelle, who, in 1240, had a disputation on the Talmud with Yechiel of Paris, and who in 1242 caused the burning of numerous Talmudic manuscripts in Paris. It is known that Thomas was personally acquainted with Nicholas. Nicholas Donin and another Jewish convert, Theobald of Cambridge, are greatly credited with the adoption and the belief of the blood libel myth in Europe.\n\nThe first known case outside England was in Blois, France, in 1171. This was the site of a blood libel accusation against the town's entire Jewish community that led to around 31–33 Jews (with 17 women making up this total) being burned to death. on 29 May of that year, or the 20th of Sivan of 4931. The blood libel revolved around R. Isaac, a Jew whom a Christian servant reported had deposited a murdered Christian in the Loire. The child's body was never found. The count had about 40 adult Blois Jews arrested and they were eventually to be burned. The surviving members of the Blois Jewish community, as well as surviving holy texts, were ransomed. As a result of this case, the Jews garnered new promises from the king. The burned bodies of the sentenced Jews were supposedly maintained unblemished through the burning, a claim which is a well-known miracle, martyr myth for both Jews and Christians. There is significant primary source material from this case including a letter revealing moves for Jewish protection with King Louis VII. Responding to the mass execution, the Twentieth of Sivan was declared a fast day by Rabbenu Tam. In this case in Blois, there was not yet the myth proclaimed that Jews needed the blood of Christians.\n\nIn 1235, after the dead bodies of five boys were found on Christmas day in Fulda, the inhabitants of the town claimed the Jews had killed them to consume their blood, and burned 34 Jews to death with the help of Crusaders assembled at the time. Even though emperor Frederick II cleared the Jews of any wrongdoing after an investigation, blood libel accusations persisted in Germany. At Pforzheim, Baden, in 1267, a woman supposedly sold a girl to Jews who, according to the myth, then cut her open and dumped her in the Enz River, where boatmen found her; the girl cried for vengeance, and then died. The body was said to have bled as the Jews were brought to it. The woman and the Jews allegedly confessed and were subsequently killed. That a judicial execution was summarily committed in consequence of the accusation is evident from the manner in which the Nuremberg \"Memorbuch\" and the synagogal poems refer to the incident.\n\nIn 1270, at Weissenburg, of Alsace, a supposed miracle alone decided the charge against the Jews. A child's body had shown up in the Lauter River; it was claimed that Jews had cut into the child to acquire his blood, and that the child continued bleeding for five days.\n\nAt Oberwesel, near Easter of 1287, alleged miracles again constituted the only evidence against the Jews. In this case, it was claimed that the corpse of the 16-year-old Werner of Oberwesel (also referred to as \"Good Werner\") landed at Bacharach and the body performed miracles, particularly medicinal miracles. Light was also said to have been emitted by the body. Reportedly, the child was hung upside down, forced to throw up the host and was cut open. In consequence, the Jews of Oberwesel and many other adjacent localities were severely persecuted during the years 1286-89. The Jews of Oberwesel were particularly targeted because there were no Jews remaining in Bacharach following a 1283 pogrom. Additionally, there were pogroms following this case as well at and around Oberwesel. Rudolph of Habsburg, to whom the Jews had appealed for protection, in order to manage the miracle story, had the archbishop of Mainz declare great wrong had been done to the Jew. This apparent declaration was very limited in effectiveness.\n\nA statement was made, in the Chronicle of Konrad Justinger of 1423, that at Bern in 1293 or 1294 the Jews tortured and murdered a boy called Rudolph (sometimes also referred to as Rudolph, Ruff, or Ruof). The body was reportedly found by the house of Jöly, a Jew. The Jewish community was then implicated. The penalties imposed upon the Jews included torture, execution, expulsion, and steep financial fines. Justinger argued Jews were out to harm Christianity. The historical impossibility of this widely credited story was demonstrated by Jakob Stammler, pastor of Bern, in 1888.\n\nThere have been several explanations put forth as to why these blood libel accusations were made and perpetuated. For example, it has been argued Thomas of Monmouth's account and other similar false accusations, as well as their perpetuation, largely had to do with the economic and political interests of leaders who did, in fact, perpetuate these myths. Additionally, it was largely believed in Europe that Jews used Christian blood for medicinal and other purposes. Despite the unsubstantiated, mythical nature of these claims, as well as their sources, they evidently materially impacted the communities in which they occurred including both the Jewish and non-Jewish populations.\n\nRenaissance and Baroque\n\nSimon of Trent, aged two, disappeared in 1475, and his father alleged that he had been kidnapped and murdered by the local Jewish community. Fifteen local Jews were sentenced to death and burned. Simon was regarded locally as a saint, although he was never canonised by the church of Rome. He was removed from the Roman Martyrology in 1965 by Pope Paul VI.\n\nChristopher of Toledo, also known as Christopher of La Guardia or \"the Holy Child of La Guardia\", was a four-year-old Christian boy supposedly murdered in 1490 by two Jews and three conversos (converts to Christianity). In total, eight men were executed. It is now believed that this case was constructed by the Spanish Inquisition to facilitate the expulsion of Jews from Spain.\n\nIn a case at Tyrnau (Nagyszombat, today Trnava, Slovakia), the absurdity, even the impossibility, of the statements forced by torture from women and children shows that the accused preferred death as a means of escape from the torture, and admitted everything that was asked of them. They even said that Jewish men menstruated and that the latter therefore practiced the drinking of Christian blood as a remedy.\n\nAt Bösing (Bazin, today Pezinok, Slovakia), it was charged that a nine-year-old boy had been bled to death, suffering cruel torture; thirty Jews confessed to the crime and were publicly burned. The true facts of the case were disclosed later when the child was found alive in Vienna. He had been taken there by the accuser, Count Wolf of Bazin, as a means of ridding himself of his Jewish creditors at Bazin.\n\nIn Rinn, near Innsbruck, a boy named Andreas Oxner (also known as Anderl von Rinn) was said to have been bought by Jewish merchants and cruelly murdered by them in a forest near the city, his blood being carefully collected in vessels. The accusation of drawing off the blood (without murder) was not made until the beginning of the 17th century when the cult was founded. The older inscription in the church of Rinn, dating from 1575, is distorted by fabulous embellishments for example, that the money paid for the boy to his godfather turned into leaves, and that a lily blossomed upon his grave. The cult continued until officially prohibited in 1994, by the Bishop of Innsbruck.\n\nOn 17 January 1670, Raphael Levy, a member of the Jewish community of Metz, was executed on charges of the ritual murder of a peasant child who had gone missing in the woods outside the village of Glatigny on 25 September 1669, the eve of Rosh Hashanah.\n\n19th century\nOne of the child-saints in the Russian Orthodox Church is the six-year-old boy Gavriil Belostoksky from the village Zverki. According to the legend supported by the church, the boy was kidnapped from his home during the holiday of Passover while his parents were away. Shutko, who was a Jew from Białystok, was accused of bringing the boy to Białystok, piercing him with sharp objects and draining his blood for nine days, then bringing the body back to Zverki and dumping it at a local field. A cult developed, and the boy was canonized in 1820. His relics are still the object of pilgrimage. On All Saints Day, 27 July 1997, the Belarusian state TV showed a film alleging the story is true. The revival of the cult in Belarus was cited as a dangerous expression of antisemitism in international reports on human rights and religious freedoms which were passed to the UNHCR.\n\n 1823–35 Velizh blood libel: After a Christian child was found murdered outside of this small Russian town in 1823, accusations by a drunk prostitute led to the imprisonment of many local Jews. Some were not released until 1835.\n 1840 Damascus affair: In February, at Damascus, a Catholic monk named Father Thomas and his servant disappeared. The accusation of ritual murder was brought against members of the Jewish community of Damascus. \n 1840 Rhodes blood libel: The Jews of Rhodes, under the Ottoman Empire, were accused of murdering a Greek Christian boy. The libel was supported by the local governor and the European consuls posted to Rhodes. Several Jews were arrested and tortured, and the entire Jewish quarter was blockaded for twelve days. An investigation carried out by the central Ottoman government found the Jews to be innocent.\n In 1844 David Paul Drach, the son of the Head Rabbi of Paris and a convert to Christianity, wrote in his book De L'harmonie Entre L'eglise et la Synagogue, that a Catholic priest in Damascus had been ritually killed and the murder covered up by powerful Jews in Europe; referring to the 1840 Damascus affair [See above]\n In the Lombardo-Venetian Kingdom in Badia, in the Province of Rovigo on June 25, 1855, a 21-year-old peasant woman from Masi, Giuditta Castilliero, returned after eight days missing and claimed she escaped from a ritual murder. She showed wounds on her arms as evidence of bloodletting, giving evidence to her story of blood libel. She testified that a fellow townsman, Caliman Ravenna, was one of the parties responsible. Ravenna was a wealthy merchant, entrepreneur, district tax collector, moneylender and member of the elite in Badia. He was taken into custody on a charge of public violence, and rumours concerning the matter spread throughout the region. The case was moved to the Court of Rovigo. There, the magistrate and other criminal authorities rapidly reviewed the case and immediately arrested the alleged perpetrator. On July 9, Giuditta Castilliero was arrested for a theft in Legnago that took place during the days she had been reportedly missing. This contradicted her testimony, and Caliman Ravenna was released on July 14 and welcomed back into his community. Castilliero was charged with slander, a more serious crime than theft, and was sentenced to six years of hard labour. It was believed she had been put up to make the accusation by a criminal network, personal enemies of Ravella.\n In March 1879, ten Jewish men from a mountain village were brought to Kutaisi, Georgia to stand trial for the alleged kidnapping and murder of a Christian girl. The case attracted a great deal of attention in Russia (of which Georgia was then a part): \"While periodicals as diverse in tendency as Herald of Europe and Saint Petersburg Notices expressed their amazement that medieval prejudice should have found a place in the modern judiciary of a civilized state, New Times hinted darkly of strange Jewish sects with unknown practices.\" The trial ended in acquittal, and the orientalist Daniel Chwolson published a refutation of the blood libel.\n 1882 Tiszaeszlár blood libel: The Jews of the village of Tiszaeszlár, Hungary were accused of the ritual murder of a fourteen-year-old Christian girl, Eszter Solymosi. The case was one of the main causes of the rise of antisemitism in the country. The accused persons were eventually acquitted.\n In 1899 Hilsner Affair: Leopold Hilsner, a Czech Jewish vagabond, was accused of murdering a nineteen-year-old Christian woman, Anežka Hrůzová, with a slash to the throat. Despite the absurdity of the charge and the relatively progressive nature of society in Austria-Hungary, Hilsner was convicted and sentenced to death. He was later convicted of an additional unsolved murder, also involving a Christian woman. In 1901, the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. Tomáš Masaryk, a prominent Austro-Czech philosophy professor and future president of Czechoslovakia, spearheaded Hilsner's defense. He was later blamed by Czech media because of this. In March 1918, Hilsner was pardoned by Austrian emperor Charles I. He was never exonerated, and the true guilty parties were never found.\n\n20th century and beyond\n\n The 1903 Kishinev pogrom, an anti-Jewish revolt, started when an anti-Semitic newspaper wrote that a Christian Russian boy, Mikhail Rybachenko, was found murdered in the town of Dubossary, alleging that the Jews killed him in order to use the blood in preparation of matzo. Around 49 Jews were killed and hundreds were wounded, with over 700 houses being looted and destroyed.\n In the 1910 Shiraz blood libel, the Jews of Shiraz, Iran, were falsely accused of murdering a Muslim girl. The entire Jewish quarter was pillaged; the pogrom left 12 Jews dead and about 50 injured.\n\n In Kyiv, a Jewish factory manager, Menahem Mendel Beilis, was accused of murdering 13-year-old Andriy Yushchinskyi, a Christian child, and using his blood to make matzos. He was acquitted by an all-Christian jury after a sensational trial in 1913.\n In 1928, the Jews of Massena, New York were falsely accused of kidnapping and killing a Christian girl in the Massena blood libel.\n Jews were frequently accused of the ritual murder of Christians for their blood in Der Stürmer, an antisemitic newspaper which was published in Nazi Germany. The infamous May 1934 issue of the paper was later banned by the Nazi authorities, because it went so far as to compare alleged Jewish ritual murder with the Christian rite of communion.\n In 1938 the British fascist politician and veterinarian Arnold Leese published an antisemitic booklet in defense of the Blood Libel which he titled My Irrelevant Defence: Meditations inside Gaol and Out on Jewish Ritual Murder.\n The 1944–1946 Anti-Jewish violence in Poland, which according to some estimates killed as many as 1000–2000 Jews (237 documented cases), involved, among other elements, accusations of blood libel, especially in the case of the 1946 Kielce pogrom.\n King Faisal of Saudi Arabia (r. 1964–1975) made accusations against Parisian Jews that took the form of a blood libel.\n\n The Matzah of Zion was written by the Syrian Defense Minister, Mustafa Tlass in 1986. The book concentrates on two issues: renewed ritual murder accusations against the Jews in the Damascus affair of 1840, and The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. The book was cited at a United Nations conference in 1991 by a Syrian delegate. On 21 October 2002, the London-based Arabic paper Al-Hayat reported that the book The Matzah of Zion was undergoing its eighth reprinting and it was also being translated into English, French and Italian. Egyptian filmmaker Munir Radhi has announced plans to adapt the book into a film.\n In 2003, a private Syrian film company created a 29-part television series Ash-Shatat (\"The Diaspora\"). This series originally aired in Lebanon in late 2003 and it was subsequently broadcast by Al-Manar, a satellite television network owned by Hezbollah. This TV series, based on the antisemitic forgery The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion, shows the Jewish people engaging in a conspiracy to rule the world, and it also presents Jews as people who murder the children of Christians, drain their blood and use it to bake matzah.\n In early January 2005, some 20 members of the Russian State Duma publicly made a blood libel accusation against the Jewish people. They approached the Prosecutor General's Office and demanded that Russia \"ban all Jewish organizations.\" They accused all Jewish groups of being extremist, \"anti-Christian and inhumane, and even accused them of practices that include ritual murders.\" Alluding to previous antisemitic Russian court decrees that accused the Jews of ritual murder, they wrote that \"Many facts of such religious extremism were proven in courts.\" The accusation included traditional antisemitic canards, such as the claim that \"the whole democratic world today is under the financial and political control of international Jewry. And we do not want our Russia to be among such unfree countries\". This demand was published as an open letter to the prosecutor general, in Rus Pravoslavnaya (, \"Orthodox Russia\"), a national-conservative newspaper. This group consisted of members of the ultra-nationalist Liberal Democrats, the Communist faction, and the nationalist Motherland party, with some 500 supporters. The mentioned document is known as \"The Letter of Five Hundred\" (\"Письмо пятисот\"). Their supporters included editors of nationalist newspapers as well as journalists. By the end of the month, this group was strongly criticized, and it retracted its demand in response.\n\n At the end of April 2005, five boys, ages 9 to 12, in Krasnoyarsk (Russia) disappeared. In May 2005, their burnt bodies were found in the city sewage. The crime was not disclosed, and in August 2007 the investigation was extended until 18 November 2007. Some Russian nationalist groups claimed that the children were murdered by a Jewish sect with a ritual purpose. Nationalist M. Nazarov, one of the authors of \"The Letter of Five Hundred\" alleges \"the existence of a 'Hasidic sect', whose members kill children before Passover to collect their blood\", using the Beilis case mentioned above as evidence. M.Nazarov also alleges that \"the ritual murder requires throwing the body away rather than its concealing\". \"The Union of the Russian People\" demanded officials thoroughly investigate the Jews, not stopping at the search in synagogues, Matzah bakeries and their offices.\n During a speech in 2007, Raed Salah, the leader of the northern branch of the Islamic Movement in Israel, referred to Jews in Europe having in the past used children's blood to bake holy bread. \"We have never allowed ourselves to knead [the dough for] the bread that breaks the fast in the holy month of Ramadan with children's blood\", he said. \"Whoever wants a more thorough explanation, let him ask what used to happen to some children in Europe, whose blood was mixed in with the dough of the [Jewish] holy bread.\"\n In the 2000s, a Polish team of anthropologists and sociologists investigated the currency of the blood libel myth in Sandomierz where a painting depicting the blood libel adorns the Cathedral and Orthodox faithful in villages near Bialystok, and they discovered that these beliefs persist among some Catholic and Orthodox Christians.\n In an address that aired on Al-Aqsa TV, a Hamas run TV station in Gaza, on 31 March 2010, Salah Eldeen Sultan (Arabic: صلاح الدين سلطان), founder of the American Center for Islamic Research in Columbus, Ohio, the Islamic American University in Southfield, Michigan, and the Sultan Publishing Co. and described in 2005 as \"one of America's most noted Muslim scholars\", alleged that Jews kidnap Christians and others in order to slaughter them and use their blood for making matzos. Sultan, who is currently a lecturer on Muslim jurisprudence at Cairo University stated that: \"The Zionists kidnap several non-Muslims Christians and others... this happened in a Jewish neighborhood in Damascus. They killed the French doctor, Toma, who used to treat the Jews and others for free, in order to spread Christianity. Even though he was their friend and they benefited from him the most, they took him on one of these holidays and slaughtered him, along with the nurse. Then they kneaded the matzos with the blood of Dr. Toma and his nurse. They do this every year. The world must know these facts about the Zionist entity and its terrible corrupt creed. The world should know this.\" (Translation by the Middle East Media Research Institute)\n During an interview which aired on Rotana Khalijiya TV on 13 August 2012, Saudi Cleric Salman Al-Odeh stated (as translated by MEMRI) that \"It is well known that the Jews celebrate several holidays, one of which is the Passover, or the Matzos Holiday. I read once about a doctor who was working in a laboratory. This doctor lived with a Jewish family. One day, they said to him: 'We want blood. Get us some human blood.' He was confused. He didn't know what this was all about. Of course, he couldn't betray his work ethics in such a way, but he began inquiring, and he found that they were making matzos with human blood.\" Al-Odeh also stated that \"[Jews] eat it, believing that this brings them close to their false god, Yahweh\" and that \"They would lure a child in order to sacrifice him in the religious rite that they perform during that holiday.\"\n In April 2013, the Palestinian non-profit organization MIFTAH, founded by Hanan Ashrawi apologized for publishing an article which criticized US President Barack Obama for holding a Passover Seder in the White House by saying \"Does Obama, in fact, know the relationship, for example, between 'Passover' and 'Christian blood'...?! Or 'Passover' and 'Jewish blood rituals?!' Much of the chatter and gossip about historical Jewish blood rituals in Europe is real and not fake as they claim; the Jews used the blood of Christians in the Jewish Passover.\" MIFTAH's apology expressed its \"sincerest regret\".\n In an interview which aired on Al-Hafez TV on 12 May 2013, Khaled Al-Zaafrani of the Egyptian Justice and Progress Party, stated (as translated by MEMRI): \"It's well known that during the Passover, they [the Jews] make matzos called the 'Blood of Zion.' They take a Christian child, slit his throat and slaughter him. Then they take his blood and make their [matzos]. This is a very important rite for the Jews, which they never forgo... They slice it and fight over who gets to eat Christian blood.\" In the same interview, Al-Zaafrani stated that \"The French kings and the Russian czars discovered this in the Jewish quarters. All the massacring of Jews that occurred in those countries were because they discovered that the Jews had kidnapped and slaughtered children, in order to make the Passover matzos.\"\nIn an interview which aired on the Al-Quds TV channel on 28 July 2014 (as translated by MEMRI), Osama Hamdan, the top representative of Hamas in Lebanon, stated that \"we all remember how the Jews used to slaughter Christians, in order to mix their blood in their holy matzos. This is not a figment of imagination or something taken from a film. It is a fact, acknowledged by their own books and by historical evidence.\" In a subsequent interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Hamdan defended his comments, stating that he \"has Jewish friends\".\n In a sermon broadcast on the official Jordanian TV channel on 22 August 2014, Sheik Bassam Ammoush, a former Minister of Administrative Development who was appointed to Jordan's House of Senate (\"Majlis al-Aayan\") in 2011, stated (as translated by MEMRI): \"In [the Gaza Strip] we are dealing with the enemies of Allah, who believe that the matzos that they bake on their holidays must be kneaded with blood. When the Jews were in the diaspora, they would murder children in England, in Europe, and in America. They would slaughter them and use their blood to make their matzos... They believe that they are God's chosen people. They believe that the killing of any human being is a form of worship and a means to draw near their god.\"\n In March 2020, Italian painter Giovanni Gasparro unveiled a painting of the martyrdom of Simon of Trent, titled \"Martirio di San Simonino da Trento (Simone Unverdorben), per omicidio rituale ebraico (The Martyrdom of St. Simon of Trento in accordance with Jewish ritual murder)\". The painting was condemned by the Italian Jewish community and the Simon Wiesenthal Center, among others.\n The QAnon conspiracy theory has been accused of advancing blood libel tropes through its belief that Hollywood elites are harvesting adrenochrome from children through Satanic ritual abuse in order to become immortal. In February 2022, a sculpture of Simon of Trent depicting the blood libel was used to promote the adrenochrome-harvesting conspiracy theory.\n\nViews of the Catholic Church\nThe attitude of the Catholic Church towards these accusations and the cults venerating children supposedly killed by Jews has varied over time. The Papacy generally opposed them, although it had problems in enforcing its opposition.\n\nIn 1911, the Dictionnaire apologétique de la foi catholique, an important French Catholic encyclopedia, published an analysis of the blood libel accusations. This may be taken as being broadly representative of educated Catholic opinion in continental Europe at that time. The article noted that the popes had generally refrained from endorsing the blood libel, and it concluded that the accusations were unproven in a general sense, but it left open the possibility that some Jews had committed ritual murders of Christians. Other contemporary Catholic sources (notably the Jesuit periodical La Civiltà Cattolica) promoted the blood libel as truth.\n\nToday, the accusations are rarer in Catholic circles. While Simon of Trent's local status as a saint was removed in 1965, several towns in Spain still commemorate the blood libel.\n\nPapal pronouncements\n Pope Innocent IV took action against the blood libel: \"5 July 1247 Mandate to the prelates of Germany and France to annul all measures adopted against the Jews on account of the ritual murder libel, and to prevent the accusation of Arabs on similar charges\" (The Apostolic See and the Jews, Documents: 492–1404; Simonsohn, Shlomo, pp. 188–189, 193–195, 208). In 1247, he wrote also that \"Certain of the clergy, and princes, nobles and great lords of your cities and dioceses have falsely devised certain godless plans against the Jews, unjustly depriving them by force of their property, and appropriating it themselves;... they falsely charge them with dividing up among themselves on the Passover the heart of a murdered boy...In their malice, they ascribe every murder, wherever it chance to occur, to the Jews. And on the ground of these and other fabrications, they are filled with rage against them, rob them of their possessions without any formal accusation, without confession, and without legal trial and conviction, contrary to the privileges granted to them by the Apostolic See... Since it is our pleasure that they shall not be disturbed,... we ordain that ye behave towards them in a friendly and kind manner. Whenever any unjust attacks upon them come under your notice, redress their injuries, and do not suffer them to be visited in the future by similar tribulations.\"\n Pope Gregory X (1271–1276) issued a letter which criticized the practice of blood libels and forbade arrests and persecution of Jews based on a blood libel, ... unless which we do not believe they be caught in the commission of the crime.\n Pope Benedict XIV wrote the bull Beatus Andreas (22 February 1755) in response to an application for the formal canonization of the 15th-century Andreas Oxner, a folk saint alleged to have been murdered by Jews \"out of hatred for the Christian faith\". Benedict did not dispute the claim that Jews murdered Christian children, and in anticipating that further cases on this basis would be brought appears to have accepted it as accurate, but decreed that in such cases beatification or canonization would be inappropriate.\n\nBlood libels in Muslim lands \nIn late 1553 or 1554, Suleiman the Magnificent, the reigning sultan of the Ottoman Empire, issued a firman (royal decree) which formally denounced blood libels against the Jews. In 1840, following the Western outrage arising from the Damascus affair, British politician and leader of the British Jewish community, Sir Moses Montefiore, backed by other influential westerners including Britain's Lord Palmerston and Damascus consul Charles Henry Churchill, the French lawyer Adolphe Crémieux, Austrian consul Giovanni Gasparo Merlato, Danish missionary John Nicolayson, and Solomon Munk, persuaded Sultan Abdulmejid I in Constantinople, to issue a firman on 6 November 1840 intended to halt the spread of blood libel accusations in the Ottoman Empire. The edict declared that blood libel accusations were a slander against Jews and they would be prohibited throughout the Ottoman Empire, and read in part:\n\n... and for the love we bear to our subjects, we cannot permit the Jewish nation, whose innocence for the crime alleged against them is evident, to be worried and tormented as a consequence of accusations which have not the least foundation in truth...\n\nIn the remainder of the 19th century and into the 20th century, there were many instances of the blood libel in Ottoman lands, such as the 1881 Fornaraki affair. However the libel almost always came from the Christian community, sometimes with the connivance of Greek or French diplomats. The Jews could usually count on the goodwill of the Ottoman authorities and increasingly on the support of British, Prussian and Austrian representatives.\n\nIn the 1910 Shiraz blood libel, the Jews of Shiraz, Iran, were falsely accused of murdering a Muslim girl. The entire Jewish quarter was pillaged, with the pogrom leaving 12 Jews dead and about 50 injured.\n\nIn 1983, Mustafa Tlass, the Syrian Minister of Defense, wrote and published The Matzah of Zion, which is a treatment of the Damascus affair of 1840 that repeats the ancient \"blood libel\", that Jews use the blood of murdered non-Jews in religious rituals such as baking Matza bread. In this book, he argues that the true religious beliefs of Jews are \"black hatred against all humans and religions\", and no Arab country should ever sign a peace treaty with Israel. Tlass re-printed the book several times. Following the book's publication, Tlass told Der Spiegel, that this accusation against Jews was valid and he also claimed that his book is \"an historical study ... based on documents from France, Vienna and the American University in Beirut.\"\n\nIn 2003, the Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram published a series of articles by Osama El-Baz, a senior advisor to the then Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Among other things, Osama El-Baz explained the origins of the blood libel against the Jews. He said that Arabs and Muslims have never been antisemitic, as a group, but he accepted the fact that a few Arab writers and media figures attack Jews \"on the basis of the racist fallacies and myths that originated in Europe\". He urged people not to succumb to \"myths\" such as the blood libel.\n\nNevertheless, on many occasions in modern times, blood libel stories have appeared in the state-sponsored media of a number of Arab and Muslim nations, as well as on their television shows and websites, and books which allege instances of Jewish blood libels are not uncommon there.\nThe blood libel was featured in a scene in the Syrian TV series Ash-Shatat, shown in 2003.\n\nIn 2007, Lebanese poet Marwan Chamoun, in an interview aired on Télé Liban, referred to the \"... slaughter of the priest Tomaso de Camangiano ... in 1840... in the presence of two rabbis in the heart of Damascus, in the home of a close friend of this priest, Daud Al-Harari, the head of the Jewish community of Damascus. After he was slaughtered, his blood was collected, and the two rabbis took it.\" A novel, Death of a Monk, based on the Damascus affair, was published in 2004.\n\nSee also\n Blood atonement\n Blood curse\n Blood ritual\n Cake of Light\n Conspiracy theory\n Human cannibalism\n Kiddush#History of using white wine\n Moral panic\n OpIndia#Bihar human sacrifice claims\n QAnon#Child sex trafficking and satanic sacrifice\n Salem witch trials\n Satanic ritual abuse\n Sefer HaRazim\n\nReferences\nNotes\n\nFurther reading\n\n Hsia, R.

Indeed it can- the use of hypnotherapy for skin complaints is backed by solid scientific evidence.\nThe “Oxford Handbook of Hypnosis: Theory, Research and Practice” is published by Oxford University, one of the most highly respected Universities in the world. Chapter 15 of this large textbook discusses the research into hypnotherapy for skin disorders.

Stanford has produced 59 Nobel prize-winners, 30 living billionaires, and 17 astronauts!\nBenham and Younger quote from 53 scientific studies supporting the effectiveness of hypnosis in treating various skin disorders, including eczema, psoriasis, and warts.\nAn important element of the therapy in many skin disorders is to get the patient to stop scratching. This is achieved partly through modifying the patient’s perception of the itching sensation, making it more bearable. A similar approach is effective with chronic pain. Hypnosis also helps by enabling the patient to notice when they are scratching and to stop immediately- because often the scratching is so habitual that the patient hardly knows they’re doing it.\nThis entry was posted in Psychological Problems on 15th April 2015 by Pete.", "url": "http://www.plymouth-hypnotherapist.co.uk/hypnotherapy-for-skin-complaints/"}

Este virus que a todos nos amenaza y al que podemos llamar “crisis”, está afectando a muchos sectores de nuestra sociedad, de forma especial a aquellos que se encuentran más desprotegidos por tener menos garantías en sus derechos, en su estabilidad o incluso en su subsistencia; y entre ellos, no cabe duda, están muchos de nuestros hermanos inmigrantes.\nPor ello un año más, y digo que van noventa y cinco, la Iglesia celebra la Jornada de las Migraciones haciéndonos caer en la cuenta de que toda enfermedad tiene su tratamiento paliativo y también, sin lugar a duda, con un poco de esfuerzo por parte de todos, una vacuna eficaz que vaya haciendo remitir los nefastos efectos que ya produce esta afección.\nLa respuesta paliativa y de cura que la Iglesia nos regala ante la situación actual nos viene dada por el lema con el que este año celebramos la citada jornada: “Ante la crisis, comunidades fraternas”. Se nos invita, como comunidades cristianas, a reconocer con generosidad todo lo que los inmigrantes han venido aportando a nuestra sociedad y a nuestras parroquias con su trabajo y su servicio; y, también, a no cerrarnos sobre nosotros mismos en este tiempo de recesión donde ellos, los más desprotegidos, están siendo los primeros en ser abandonados a su suerte.\nEs una llamada a renovar y reforzar nuestro servicio de Iglesia en la atención a nuestros hermanos inmigrantes, refugiados y víctimas de cualquier forma de abuso o explotación y a hacerlo desde la fraternidad como signo que nos identifica. Un reto continuo que, desde la fe, se ha de transformar para nosotros en compromiso fraterno que nace, sobre todo, de la comunión con el Señor que nos ha amado hasta dar la vida por nosotros y que nos ha mandado a hacer lo mismo; ya que cuanto más unidos estamos a Cristo, tanto más solícitos hemos de mostrarnos con el prójimo y, cuánto más nos identificamos con ÉL, más debe llevarnos a amar y servir a nuestros hermanos.\nNadie ha dicho que sea fácil asumir que, en parte, la solución de los grandes problemas del mundo pasa por lograr transformar nuestro entorno, por cambiar nuestros “chips” y abrirnos a la llamada que nos hace la Iglesia a la fraternidad… pero hemos de recordar que lo verdaderamente valioso no suele estar al alcance de la mano, o en palabras de Jesús: “Allí donde está tu tesoro, está tu corazón”. Por lo que podemos afirmar que el antídoto lo tenemos, está en nuestro corazón, está en la fraternidad vivida y compartida; pero… ¿estamos dispuestos a producir esa vacuna que nace en nuestro interior y construir así un mundo distinto?\nLa Jornada de Las Migraciones este año nos invita, como se nos ha indicado en estas fechas, a construir verdaderas comunidades fraternas, unidas, donde no haya diferencias. Ante la realidad de la crisis en la que estamos inmersos, debe abrirnos los ojos para reconocer que estamos llamados a vivir según el estilo de Jesús, teniendo a Dios como Padre común de todos y, por tanto, sintiéndonos auténticamente hermanos los unos de los otros, seamos de la raza, color, lengua que seamos.\nComo responsable de la Delegación Diocesana de Migraciones, quiero proclamar hoy y aquí que los inmigrantes no son, ni mucho menos, un problema o una amenaza para nuestras Islas Canarias. Quiero afirmar que son uno de los mejores regalos que Dios nos está haciendo para enriquecer nuestra sociedad y nuestra Iglesia, para rejuvenecerla y llenarla de nuevos retos, donde la fraternidad ha de ser nuestra nota identificativa. Tengamos en cuenta que, ante la crisis, está en juego su dignidad y la de sus familias y, por tanto, nada, ni los brotes de violencia esporádicos, ni la delincuencia, ni las mafias que trafican con seres humanos… pueden ser pretexto para abandonar la solidaridad verdadera, porque contra la crisis sólo hay un remedio: fraternidad.\nQueremos agradecer desde aquí la acogida del Arciprestazgo de la Cuesta, de su equipo de sacerdotes, de D. Norberto y D. Celso, como párroco y diácono de la Comunidad Parroquial de Ntra. Sra. de Las Nieves que hoy nos acoge en esta Celebración del Día de las Migraciones. Agradecer igualmente a nuestro Obispo, D. Bernardo, su presencia y presidencia en la Eucaristía y sus, siempre, acertadas intervenciones en prensa, radio, etc. en cuanto se refiere a la realidad de la Migración en nuestras tierras. Gracias por el ánimo y apoyo que manifiesta a la Delegación de Migraciones en todo momento… y gracias también, como Delegado, al Equipo de la Delegación por su esfuerzo y dedicación en este campo de la Pastoral. ¡Dios Sabrá recompensar la labor realizada!\nPor último gracias a la misma comunidad parroquial y de forma especial a quienes no naciendo en Canarias os sentís familia en esta o cualquier otra Parroquia y nos estáis invitando continuamente a recordar, con vuestra presencia, que la fe no tiene fronteras y que la Iglesia es un regalo universal del que podemos disfrutar si abrimos el corazón a Dios y al hermano, venga de donde venga, y vivimos en fraternidad.

{"text": "Herbal blood tonics for anaemic conditions\n\nHerbal blood tonics for anaemic conditions\nNigerian researchers have in clinical studies shown that extracts of fluted pumpkin, cowhage or velvet bean, fig and sorghum could be effectively used to improve blood count, as an alternative or compliment to blood transfusion, and heal anaemic conditions such as in sickle cell anaemia and malaria. CHUKWUMA MUANYA (Assistant Editor) writes.\n*Fluted pumpkin leaves, cowhage, fig, sorghum, others show promise, researchers find\nNigerian researchers have shown the efficacy of fluted pumpkin vegetable extracts in the management of severe anemia in children.\nAccording to the study published in The Internet Journal of Alternative Medicine and The study was published in Tropical Journal of Pharmaceutical Research, case reports of two severely anaemic patients, whose parents refused blood transfusion and were subsequently managed with oral intakes of the fluted pumpkin vegetable extracts, with satisfactory rise in the haematocrit levels.\nThe results showed that the pre-pumpkin extracts administration pack cell volume of 15 per cent in both of them, rose to 20 per cent in one and 25 per cent in the other, 24 hours post administration of the extract.\nThe researchers concluded: “The fluted pumpkin vegetable extract was efficacious in the management of severe anemia in these two children and may be useful in pediatric patients with severe anemia whose parents refuse blood transfusion. The vegetable extract may have an even greater role in the prevention of anemia if intake is instituted early. Wider studies are needed to investigate these hypotheses.”\nCommonly called fluted pumpkin, Telfairia occidentalis is called Ugu in Ibo; Aworoko, Eweroko in Yoruba, Ikong or Umee in Efik and Ibibio, and Umeke in Edo\nAnaemia is a common childhood disease in the third world countries. It is sometimes life threatening and may require urgent blood transfusion. However parents occasionally refuse blood transfusion because of religious or other reasons. Members of the Jehovah witness sect usually refuse blood transfusion for themselves and their wards because of some biblical injunction. The problems and costs attending blood transfusion in our poorly developed health services often tempt some parents to refuse the procedure. It is therefore imperative for physicians to be aware of all available alternatives to blood transfusion.\nFluted pumpkin was found useful in correcting anaemia in a study of some African pregnant women. In the study, thirty anaemic pregnant women with base line pack cell volumes of 20.8+/-2.0 per cent were given freshly prepared fluted pumpkin mixture, containing its fluid extract, raw eggs and evaporated unsweetened milk, orally three times daily for seven days. The mean pack cell volume was observed to have increased to 29.5+/-2.2 per cent, a day following the administration of the mixture.\nThere is no documentation of the use of fluted pumpkin in the management of anaemia in children. However, this study by researchers at the Department of Paediatrics, Ladoke Akintola University Teaching Hospital, Osogbo, Osun State, led by Dr. Olusola Adetunji Oyedeji, draws the attention of medical practitioners managing children to the possibility of fluted pumpkin acting as a surrogate to refused blood transfusion in anaemic children. It may also have a role in preventing anaemia.\nThe researchers also acknowledged the contributions of Prof. G. A. Oyedeji of the department of Pediatrics, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ife, Osun State.\nThe researchers wrote: “Life threatening anaemia is a common emergency among Nigerian paediatric admissions. Malaria, sickle cell disease, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and septicemia are common causes. The logical and most effective method of managing such cases to is by blood transfusion. However, as in these reports, parents occasionally refuse blood transfusion for their children because of religious, cultural, financial and other reasons.\n“In our practice setting, the direct cost of screening and transfusion services to the patient for a pint of blood ranges between $10 and 20. This is often unaffordable to many parents. Thus in a study of patients discharged against medical advice, financial constraints was given as the reason for refusing blood transfusion by the parents of some severely anemic, because of their inability to procure the blood needed for transfusion. Cultural practices in many parts of Africa dictate that mothers should obtain permission from their husbands before submitting their children for medical care and procedures like blood transfusion. This may make a mother refuse transfusion when the family situation is not congenial. Sometimes such fathers are unavailable or inaccessible to give consent.\n“Concerning complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), most physicians are poorly informed on, the use of herbs for medical conditions. Sometimes patients and their relations are better informed compared to the attending physician. This was the case in these two patients, in whom the fluted pumpkin was effective. Fluted pumpkin is an indigenous pumpkin to the eastern parts of Nigeria. Usually, it is administered either as an extract obtained from blending or manually squeezing the soaked vegetable leaves in tepid water in order to extract the fluid, or it can be eaten as a cooked vegetable. Its mechanism of action is not known. Extracts from fluted pumpkin are known to have reducing and free radical scavenging properties through its antioxidant phyto-constituents such as vitamin C and phenols. These anti-oxidants may reduce tissue and red cell destruction by free radicals. The fluted pumpkin is also rich in folic acid and iron, which may be more easily bio-available for erythropesis compared to nutrients from other sources. Due to the fact that there are no suitable alternative oxygen carrier substitutes for haemoglobin, erythropoesis remains the safest means of alleviating hypoxemia from very low haematocrit levels.\n“The two cases have also shown that fluted pumpkin acts very fast and its effects were evident within 24 hours. Other haematinics such as erythropoetin, iron, folic acid and vitamin B complex do not work as fast as fluted pumpkin. It takes a range of five days to three weeks after administration before their effects can be seen. The other advantages of fluted pumpkin over blood transfusions are avoidance of transmission of infections and blood transfusion reactions. In addition, the cost of administering fluted pumpkin is much less than giving a pint of blood, or erythropoeitin. Fluted pumpkin therapy reduces the number of days that the patient spends on admission, waiting for the improvement in pack cell volume when being managed with haematinics. All this not withstanding, blood transfusion acts faster than any other method by raising the pack cell volume immediately the blood is transfused.\n“In order to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with anemia in children whose parents refuse blood transfusion for them, the etiology of the anemia should be investigated and treated promptly. Fluted pumpkin extracts should be administered. The vegetable can also be given as part of the diet to children predisposed to developing severe anemia, such as sicklers and G-6-PD deficient patients when they are being treated for malaria. Thus fluted pumpkin has both prophylactic and curative roles and it has the potentiality of reducing the frequency and problems of blood transfusion in paediatric practice. Detailed studies of its mechanism of action should however be undertaken prior to liberalizing its use. Cautionary measures may also need to be taken with respect to prolonged use, especially in sicklers, in order to prevent pathologic tissue deposits of iron. The use of alternative methods of treatment is rapidly increasing among patients and the physicians needs to be conversant with these therapies.”\nCommonly called cowhage, velvet bean (Agbala or Agbaloko in Ibo and Werepe in Yoruba), the leaves and seeds of Mucuna pruriens could be effectively used to boost blood levels and fertility in women.\nSo patients with low blood levels may no longer have need for blood transfusion and taking of blood capsules or tonics. Also, women that are looking for the fruit of the womb need not despair.\nA study published in journal Biokemistri by researchers from Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, Anambra State, comparative effects of ethanolic extracts of Ficus carica (fig tree) and Mucuna pruriens leaves on haematological parameters in albino rats.\nThe comparative effects of the ethanolic extracts of Ficus carica (fig) and Mucuna pruriens (cowhage or velvet bean) on haematological parameters were investigated in albino rats. The animals were divided into three main groups: group 1 which, served as the control, received 5.0ml/kg body weight of normal saline, while groups two and three received a daily administration (per os) of 200mg/k/g body weight of extracts of M. pruriens and F. carica respectively for 14 days.\nResults showed that the extracts significantly increased the haemoglobin concentration, Packed Cell Volume (PCV) and red blood cell count by the 14th day when compared with the control.\nF. carica was found to be more effective than M. pruriens in elevating the red blood cell count, especially by the 14th day. The two extracts, however, significantly decreased the total white blood cell count, as well as the percentage neutrophils, when compared with the control group, but not significant between test groups, even by the 14thday. Phytochemical analyses showed the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, cardiac glycosides and carbohydrates in both plants. Tannins were present in F. carica but not in M. pruriens. These results thus justify the ethnobotanical use of these plants as blood building herbs.\nAlso, researchers have demonstrated the anti-anaemic potentials of aqueous extract of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) stem bark in rats.\nSorghum bicolor belongs to the plant family Poaceae. It makes a refreshing non-alcoholic beverage, kunu-zaki (in Hausa), and tasty pap, akamu (in Ibo), and thick porridge, tuwo dawa (in Hausa). It is fermented to make sorghum beer called burkutu or pito, or made into flour and mixed with bean flour then fried to make dawaki.\nTemidayo Oladiji, T. O. Jacob and Musa Yakubu of the University of Ilorin, Kwara State, published the study in Journal of Ethnopharmacology.\nThe researchers investigated the effects of oral administration of aqueous extract of Sorghum bicolor stem bark at the doses of 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg body weight on iron sufficient and iron deficient weaning rats. Weaning rats of 21 days old were maintained on iron sufficient and iron deficient diets for six weeks before the administration of the aqueous extract of Sorghum bicolor stem bark at various doses for seven days. Proximate analysis of the iron sufficient and iron deficient diets showed that they were similar except in the amount of iron.\nPhytochemical screening of the extract revealed the presence of alkaloids and saponins. Extract administration produced significant increase in haemoglobin, packed cell volume and red blood cells in iron sufficient and iron deficient groups. There was also significant increase in the catalase activity of the rat liver and kidney without any significant change in the serum catalase activity.\nThe results revealed that extract administration has restored the anaemic condition in the iron deficient group and thus lend credence to its use in folklore medicine in the management of anaemia.\nAnother study published in African Journal of Biomedical Research evaluated pharmacological effect of a Nigerian Polyherbal health tonic tea in rats.\nThe researchers from the Departments of Pharmacology and Pathology/Forensic Medicine, Lagos State University College of Medicine, Ikeja, Lagos, conducted a fourteen day study, designed to investigate the haematological and biochemical effects of single, daily oral doses of 100 – 600 mg/kg of a Nigerian Polyherbal Tonic Tea (PHT) in four groups of adult Wistar rats.\nAcute oral toxicity test of PHT at the limit dose of 5000 mg/kg was also conducted using Up-and-Down Procedure on statistical software programme (AOT425StatPgm, Version 1.0.). Results showed PHT to induce significant dose-related elevation in the PCV, platelet, total leukocyte counts and lymphocyte differentials, while causing significant suppression of granulocyte differentials in dose-related fashion. PHT, also, induced a significant dose-dependent rise in the fasting blood sugar, which was at variance with its folkloric use as an oral hypoglycemic agent. PHT did not induce mortality at the tested limit oral dose, indicating its relative oral safety up to 5000 mg/kg on acute exposure.\nPHT is one of the several polyherbal remedies in Nigeria, used in folkloric medicine in Southwest Nigeria for the treatment of an array of diseases affecting humans. It is composed of pulverized, dried leaves of Persea Africana or avocado pear (Lauraeae), Morinda lucida (Rubiaceae), Magnifera indica or mango (Anacardiaceae), Carica papaya or pawpaw (Caricaceae), Vernonia amygdalina or bitter leaf (Compositae) and Cassia occidentalis or stinging weed/coffee weed (Caesalpiniaceae), all combined in equal weight ratio.\nMorinda lucida belongs to the plant family Rubiaceae. It is commonly called Brimstone tree. It is Oruwo or Erewo in Yoruba, Eze-ogu or Njisi in Ibo.\nPHT is used for the treatment of pain, blood deficiencies, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, malaria, fever, inflammations, as immune booster and in the improvement of blood circulation.\nThis post was syndicated from The Guardian Nigeria Newspaper.

{"text": "The term Subantarctic is defined as ‘of, pertaining to, similar to, or being the region immediately north of the Antarctic Circle; subpolar.’ The term has a number of variations on capitalization and hyphen use including subantarctic, Sub-Antarctic and sub-Antarctic. For this website I’ve decided to stay with the term Subantarctic.\nWhen I tell people I’m heading to the Subantarctic, the response is often along the lines of ‘Antarctica? You’ll see a lot of ice’. Unlike the fixed, charismatic bulk of Antarctica, sitting squarely in our ideas of the earth’s penultimate freezing south, the Subantarctic is a world encircling, oceanic, almost landless region.\nForming the northern edge of the Southern Ocean, the Subantarctic can be loosely defined as the northern waters of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current where the cold northerly flowing waters of the Antarctic Polar Front, also known as the Antarctic Convergence mix with and sink beneath the warm, southward moving waters of the Subtropical Front. The Biogeographic Atlas of the Southern Ocean explores this complex system in more detail.\nRanging between the 42nd and 58th southern parallels of latitude, the Subantarctic cannot be described by straight lines on a map. The sinuous oceanic fronts bordering the region are influenced by atmospheric forces from above and the topography of the ocean floor below. Spreading over the deep basins and wide plateaus of the southern Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans to surge through the sharp pinch of the Drake Passage between South America’s southern tip and the Antarctic Peninsular, Subantarctic waters are in perpetual motion around the base of the earth’s globe.\nThe dynamic and non-liner nature of Subantarctic oceanic fronts is best illustrated by the environmental differences between Macquarie Island and South Georgia, both of which lie on the 54th southern parallel of latitude but on the north and south side, respectively, of the Antarctic Polar Front. As first compared by the Russian navigator Captain Thaddeus von Bellingshausen in 1820, Macquarie Island is a green refuge supporting thriving stands of tussock grass, endemic Macquarie Island cabbage (Stilbocarpa polaris, the roots of which were used as an early scurvy remedy by sealers left on the island for months, and exploratory expeditions) and megaherbs, while South Georgia is bound year round with ice, snow and glaciers. This is due to a major northward curve in the ocean fronts after they pass through the Drake Passage, drawing up cold Antarctic waters around South Georgia.\nWhile the Subantarctic is certainly cold – summer temperatures rarely hit double figures – it is more wet and windy than consistently ice bound. For instance, Macquarie Island averages 900 mm of precipitation per year. The freezing icebergs of Antarctica do not always survive far into the Subantarctic, at least during summer, but snow, sleet and hail are common, driven by the constant winds of the Roaring Forties and Furious Fifties. The islands below Australia and New Zealand visited on my trip (The Snares, Auckland Island, Macquarie Island and Campbell Island) do not support glaciers, but are frequently covered in snow through the long southern winter. Some Subantarctic islands do have glaciers, Heard Island and South Georgia being 2 examples.\nCharacterised by the mixing of cold, nutrient rich Antarctic waters with warmer currents from the north, the Subantarctic region is filled with marine life and biological diversity. Despite a long history of exploitation the islands of the Subantarctic now provide secure breeding grounds for literally millions of marine mammals and birds, and habitats for highly specialised plants, many of which cannot be found anywhere else in the world.\nThere are 22 Subantarctic island groups scattered around the base of the world, claimed by Australia, New Zealand, Norway, France, the UK and South Africa. Largely uninhabited by humans since the mid-20th century, the value of these islands as wildlife refuges has become well recognised. Australia’s three Subantarctic island groups – the Heard and Macdonald Islands and Macquarie Island – are listed on the World Heritage register, as are New Zealand’s Subantarctic islands, for their outstanding environmental, historical and geological values. Of these island groups Macquarie Island is currently the only one with a year-round human presence, supporting a staff of rangers, technicians and researchers.\nOn a planet packed with more than 7 billion people, the Subantarctic is not spared human impact or activity. There are long-established krill and finfish fisheries throughout the region, and in recent years tourism in the Subantarctic has gained pace.\nWhile Antarctica draws the bulk of tourists below the 48th parallel, expeditions to the regions south of New Zealand and Australia have increased. The islands can still only be visited by boat, and eco-tourism expeditions, like the one I traveled on are becoming more frequent features of the Subantarctic summer.\nTo manage this relatively new industry, the Australian and New Zealand governments have developed guidelines and protocols for tourism operators to minimise impacts from tourism, primarily the Guidelines for Tourist Visits to Macquarie Island Nature Reserve and World Heritage Area (Australia) and the Subantarctic Minimum Impact Code (New Zealand). From decimated oil resource to tourism drawcard, the wildlife and landscapes of the Subantarctic have become a new kind of asset, and the wider world is once more paying attention to what happens in the Furious Fifties.\nDespite this renewed interest the Subantarctic remains one of the last really wild places on earth, governed by implacable water and wind. I feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to experience this truly remote region.", "url": "https://voyagingsouth.com/about/"}

{"text": "Gov’t rice policy exposes PH to price spikes, shortages, says economist\n\nThe Philippine approach to rice production and supply management continues to expose the country to shortages and price spikes, as its agricultural policy remains unchanged over several administrations despite disastrous results, an economist said on Monday.\nUniversity of the Philippines professor Ramon L. Clarete said Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel Piñol was doing the same things that his predecessor had done.\nClarete was referring to Proceso Alcala, who championed the Aquino administration’s push for rice self-sufficiency and took the blame for its failure.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPiñol on Sunday lashed out at economists and think tanks after the Inquirer reported on a commentary from New York-based Global Source Partners, which warned that the Duterte administration’s rice policy exposed the country to the risk of falling stocks and spiking prices.\nAs Piñol himself announced last week, “President Rody Duterte has ordered the National Food Authority (NFA) to buy the paddy rice produce of Filipino farmers and import only if there is a shortfall.”\nClarete described this policy as “local procurement first, we are not by the way against rice imports, and there is no need to import rice because we are sufficient in supply.”\nPiñol took issue with economists and think tanks for suggesting that the ban on imports be reconsidered and that the NFA be allowed to import quickly as its buffer stock was running low and the lean months were approaching.\nHe said he never said that there should be no importation. “All that I asked the President was not to allow importation at peak harvest season.”\nWrong equation\nBut Clarete said Piñol, like his predecessor, mistakenly equated sufficiency with no importation. “If local supply is equal to local consumption, that is 100-percent sufficiency all right but at a higher price,” Clarete told the Inquirer. “There is rice availability (supply may not drop) but access to that supply may not be inclusive because of the higher price.”\n“So if the price goes up in the coming months, because of the ‘no need to import rice because we are sufficient in supply’ policy, the supply is not enough for the poor consumers,” Clarete said.\nIn his post on social media, Piñol said Mr. Duterte’s order to defer imports until after the harvest resulted in farmers’ income rising by P24.38 billion in the first quarter.\nADVERTISEMENT\nClarete said the beneficiaries of the P24.38 billion included “greedy big farmers who informally ‘bought’ the rice lands of agrarian reform beneficiaries” as well as the few farmers (big or small) who are active members of farmers’ associations.\nFarmers’ divide\n“We had heard this before, and politicians do not appreciate the divide between the small and big farmers, the small farmers and traders/creditors, and the unorganized and organized rice farmers,” Clarete said.\nCiting data from a satellite-data processing technology developed by the International Rice Research Institute, Piñol said farm yield in the first quarter increased to 4.14 million metric tons of palay even as the harvest area decreased to 997,687 hectares.\nThe economist noted that Agriculture Secretary Roberto S. Sebastian of the Ramos administration expected good production in the 1994-1995 cropping season and no rice importation, based on a survey of farmers’ planting intentions.\n“The year following he was out of office when the poor queued at the NFA warehouses for rice in an election year,” Clarete said.\nWays to fix leaks\nClarete suggested three ways to “fix the leaks in the bucket” by throwing away the old bucket and getting a new one.\nFirst is giving cash transfer directly to the bottom 60 percent of rice farmers, coupled with enabling the farmers the right to opt for paying their creditors/traders with cash from the loan proceeds using the warehouse receipts; or giving up their rice to traders in payment for their debt obligation as now practiced.\nSecond, in the next five years, enact a good warehouse receipts law in which farmers can deposit their paddy rice and use the warehouse receipts to borrow money from rural banks or Landbank coupled with enabling the farmers the right to two options similar to the cash transfer proposal.\nFor the long haul, “(let us) free agriculture from agriculture secretaries who equate good performance with zero rice imports,” Clarete said.\nPiñol said he never called for zero importation. “Tell (Clarete) the Philippines must be free from armchair economic experts who could not even read properly. I have an extra pair of eyeglasses. I could give it to him.”", "url": "http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/889910/govt-rice-policy-exposes-ph-to-price-spikes-shortages-says-economist"}
{"text": "Rosemary Menkens (LNP) since 2004.\nBurdekin is a mixed north Queensland electorate that stretches along the Bruce Highway and the Coast from Bowen to the southern suburbs of Townsville. It also stretches inland to take in the mining town of Collinsville. The electorate is centred on the agricultural areas around Ayr-Home Hill, but also includes the outskirts of Townsville, taking in built up areas south and east of the Ross River including Wulguru and the Lavarack Army Barracks.\nFirst created in 1950, Burdekin was held by Independent Arthur Coburn from 1950 until his retirement in 1969. The seat was then a safe National Party seat, held by Val Bird 1969-83 and Mark Stoneman from 1983 to 1998 when the seat fell to One Nation's Jeff Knuth. Like all the One Nation MPs, Knuth left the party during his term, contesting the 2001 election for the City Country Alliance. Knuth finished in third place, at least having the solace of outpolling the new One Nation candidate, but with 60% of One Nation and City Country Alliance preferences exhausting, the Labor Party's Steve Rodgers surprisingly became Burdekin's first Labor MP. Rodgers' victory was entirely due to optional preferential voting, polling only 36.7% of the first preference vote compared to a combined 63.3% for his three conservative opponents.\nIn 2004, Rodgers retained his primary vote, but stronger flows of preferences between conservative candidates produced a 9.5% swing to the National Party, electing current MP Rosemary Menkens. Rogers contested the seat again in 2006 and achieved a 2% swing to Labor, but not enough to defeat Menkens. Burdekin had not been marginal before the 1992 redistribution, when the addition of areas on the edge of Townsville increased the seat's Labor vote. The 1999 redistribution added the Labor-voting mining town of Collinsville, and the 2008 redistribution added Bowen, turning Burdekin into a notional Labor seat again. However Menkens gained a 4% swing at the 2009 election and was easily re-elected to Parliament.\nNickson holds a Master’s degree in Social Work, is a qualified Justice of the Peace and is currently a Lecturer at James Cook University. She has lived and worked in the region for nearly 20 years and has held positions in different areas of the field of social work and been a national Board Member of the Australian Association of Social Workers. Nickson contested Mundingurra for Family First at the 2009 election and was a Senate candidate in 2010.\nZyla moved to Bowen from South Australia in 1993. She trained as a teacher and started work as a Teacher Librarian at Queens Beach State School in Bowen in 1997. She is active in the Queensland’s Teachers Union.\n65 year-old Menkens worked as a director of a family farming enterprise while also finding time to raise her family. Menkens has also worked as a vocational teacher teaching business management, communications and office practice. Before her election Menkens also served as Chairman of the Burdekin College of TAFE Educational Training Advisory Group and was also involved in numerous community groups.

No, because an inline function or method has exactly the same characteristics as a regular one, most important one being that they are both type safe. And yes, because the assembly code generated by the compiler will be different; with a regular function, each call will be translated into several steps: pushing parameters on the stack, making the jump to the function, popping the parameters, etc, whereas a call to an inline function will be replaced by its actual code, like a macro.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>Is inline code simply a \"form\" of macros?</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>No</strong>! A macro is simple text replacement, which can lead to severe errors. Consider the following code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#define unsafe(i) ( (i) &gt;= 0 ? (i) : -(i) )\n\n[...]\nunsafe(x++); // x is incremented twice!\nunsafe(f()); // f() is called twice!\n[...]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Using an inline function, you're sure that parameters will be evaluated before the function is actually performed. They will also be type checked, and eventually converted to match the formal parameters types.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>What kind of tradeoff must be done when choosing to inline your code?</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Normally, program execution should be faster when using inline functions, but with a bigger binary code.

{"text": "Chipre • es.knowledger.de\nChipre , oficialmente la república de Chipre , es un país insular en el Mar Mediterráneo del Este. Chipre es la tercera isla más grande y la tercera más populosa en el Mediterráneo y un Estado miembro de la Unión Europea. Se localiza al sur de Turquía, al Oeste de Siria y Líbano, al noroeste de Israel, al norte de Egipto y al este de Grecia.\nLa actividad humana conocida más temprana en las fechas de la isla a aproximadamente el 10mo milenio A.C. Arqueológico permanece a partir de este período incluyen el pueblo Neolítico bien conservado de Khirokitia, y Chipre es patria de algunos los pozos acuáticos más viejos en el mundo. Chipre fue colocado por griegos Mycenaean en dos ondas en el 2do milenio A.C. En una ubicación estratégica en el Oriente Medio, fue ocupado posteriormente por varios poderes principales, incluso los Imperios de los asirios, egipcios y persas, de quien la isla fue agarrada en 333 A.C. por Alexander the Great. La regla subsecuente por Egipto Ptolemaic, el Imperio Romano Clásico y del Este, califatos árabes para un período corto, la dinastía Lusignan francesa y los venecianos, fue seguida antes de más de tres siglos de la regla del Otomano entre 1571 y 1878 (de jure hasta 1914).\nChipre se colocó bajo la administración británica el 4 de junio de 1878 (formalmente anexado por Gran Bretaña el 5 de noviembre de 1914, en respuesta a la decisión del gobierno del Otomano de afiliarse a la Primera guerra mundial en el lado de los Poderes Centrales) hasta que se concediera la independencia en 1960, haciéndose un miembro de la Comunidad en 1961. En 1963, la violencia intercomunal de 11 años entre chipriotas griegos y chipriotas turcos comenzó, que casi provocó una guerra en 1964 entre Turquía y Grecia. Esto se evitó a través de la mediación de última hora del presidente de los Estados Unidos Lyndon B. Johnson. Diez años más tarde, el 15 de julio de 1974, el golpe de estado chipriota fue organizado por nacionalistas chipriotas griegos y elementos de la junta militar griega con el objetivo de conseguir Enosis (unión de Chipre con Grecia). Turquía, como uno de los tres \"estados del Garante\" en Chipre (juntos con el Reino Unido y Grecia) según el Tratado de la Garantía (1960), usó la tentativa de Enosis como un pretexto para invadir la parte del norte de la isla cinco días más tarde, el 20 de julio de 1974. Las fuerzas turcas permanecieron en Chipre después del alto el fuego, causando la división eficaz de la isla, un objetivo de Turquía desde 1955. La violencia intercomunal, el golpe intentado por fuerzas griegas e invasión turca subsecuente llevaron al desplazamiento de más de 150.000 chipriotas griegos y 50.000 chipriotas turcos y el establecimiento en 1983 de una entidad política chipriota turca separada en el norte. Estos acontecimientos y la situación política que resulta son asuntos de una disputa persistente.\nLa república de Chipre tiene de jure la soberanía sobre la isla de Chipre y sus aguas circundantes, según el derecho internacional, excepto el Territorio Extranjero británico de Akrotiri y Dhekelia, administrado como áreas Bajas Soberanas. Sin embargo, la república de Chipre de facto se divide en dos partes principales; el área bajo el control eficaz de la república, comprendiendo aproximadamente el 59% del área de la isla y el área controlada por el turco en el norte, llamándose la república turca de Chipre del Norte y reconocido sólo por Turquía, cubriendo aproximadamente el 36% del área de la isla. La comunidad internacional considera la parte del norte de la isla como el territorio de la república de Chipre ilegalmente ocupada por fuerzas turcas.\nChipre es un destino turístico principal en el Mediterráneo. Con una, economía de ingresos altos avanzada y un Índice de Desarrollo humano muy alto, la república de Chipre era un miembro fundador del Movimiento No alineado hasta que se afiliara a la Unión Europea el 1 de mayo de 2004. El 1 de enero de 2008, la república de Chipre se afilió a la Eurozona.\nLa referencia atestiguada más temprana a Chipre es el 15to siglo A.C. griego de Mycenaean, ku pi ri jo, significando \"el chipriota\" (griego:), escrito en escritura silábica B Lineal.\nLa forma griega clásica del nombre es.\nLa etimología del nombre es desconocida.\nLas suposiciones incluyen:\nla palabra griega para el ciprés Mediterráneo (Cupressus sempervirens),  (kypárissos)\nel nombre griego de la planta de la alheña (Lawsonia alba),  (kýpros)\nuna palabra de Eteocypriot para cobre. Georges Dossin, por ejemplo, sugiere que tiene raíces en la palabra sumeria para el cobre (zubar) o para el bronce (kubar), de los depósitos grandes de mineral de cobre encontrado a la isla.\nA través del comercio exterior, la isla ha dado su nombre a la palabra latina Clásica para el cobre a través de la frase aes Cyprium, \"el metal de Chipre\", más tarde se acortó a Cuprum.\nChipre, más expresamente la costa del mar en Paphos, también era uno de los lugares de nacimiento dados en la mitología griega para Afrodita, que se conocía como Kýpria. Esto era porque Astarte, la diosa del amor y belleza en la mitología fenicia, de quien Chipre era un centro de culto importante, se identificó más tarde con Afrodita.\nEl estándar demonym relacionándose con Chipre o su gente o cultura es chipriota. Los términos Cypriote y Cyprian también se usan, aunque menos con frecuencia.\nChipre prehistórico y Antiguo\nEl sitio confirmado más temprano de la actividad humana en Chipre es Aetokremnos, situado en la costa del sur, indicando que los cazadores-recolectores eran activos a la isla de aproximadamente 10.000 A.C., con comunidades del pueblo colocadas que datan de 8.200 A.C. La llegada de la primera gente guarda correlación con la extinción de hippos enano y elefantes enanos. Se cree que los pozos acuáticos descubiertos por arqueólogos en Chipre occidental están entre el más viejo en el mundo, fechado en 9.000 a 10.500 años.\nLos restos de un gato de 8 meses se descubrieron sepultados con un cuerpo humano en un sitio Neolítico separado en Chipre. Se estima que la tumba tiene 9.500 años (7500 A.C.), precediendo la civilización egipcia antigua y empujando atrás la asociación felina y humana conocida más temprana considerablemente. El pueblo Neolítico notablemente bien conservado de Khirokitia es un Sitio del Patrimonio universal de la UNESCO que data a aproximadamente 6.800 A.C.\nDurante la Edad de Bronce tardía la isla experimentó dos ondas del establecimiento griego. La primera onda consistió en comerciantes griegos Mycenaean que comenzaron a visitar Chipre alrededor de 1400 A.C. Se cree que una onda principal del establecimiento griego ha ocurrido después de colapso de la Edad de Bronce de Grecia Mycenaean de 1100 a 1.050 A.C., con el carácter predominantemente griego de la isla que data a partir de este período. Chipre ocupa un papel importante en la mitología griega que es el lugar de nacimiento de Afrodita y Adonis, y a casa al rey Cinyras, Teucer y Pygmalion. Comenzando en el 8vo siglo A.C. las colonias fenicias se fundaron en la costa del sur de Chipre, cerca del día de hoy Larnaca y Salames.\nChipre fue gobernado por Assyria durante un siglo que comienza en 708 A.C., antes de una breve ortografía bajo gobierno egipcio y finalmente gobierno persa en 545 A.C. Los chipriotas, conducidos por Onesilus, rey de Salames, se afiliaron a sus griegos del mismo tipo en las ciudades de Ionian durante la Rebelión de Ionian fracasada en 499 A.C. contra el Imperio de Achaemenid. La rebelión se suprimió, pero Chipre logró mantener un alto grado de autonomía y permaneció orientado hacia el mundo griego.\nLa isla fue conquistada por Alexander the Great en 333 A.C. Después de su muerte y la división subsecuente de su Imperio entre sus sucesores, Chipre se hizo la parte del Imperio helenístico de Ptolemaic Egipto. Era durante este período que la isla era totalmente Hellenized. En 58 A.C. Chipre fue adquirido por la república romana.\nCuando el Imperio Romano se dividió en partes del Este y Occidentales en 395, Chipre se hizo la parte del romano del Este o Imperio Bizantino, y permanecería así hasta las Cruzadas aproximadamente 800 años más tarde. Según la regla Bizantina, la orientación griega que había sido prominente desde la antigüedad desarrolló el carácter helenístico-cristiano fuerte que sigue siendo un sello de la comunidad chipriota griega.\nComenzando en 649, Chipre sufrió de incursiones devastadoras lanzadas por ejércitos musulmanes del Levante, que siguió durante los próximos 300 años. Muchos eran incursiones piráticas rápidas, pero los otros eran ataques a gran escala en los cuales muchos chipriotas se mataron y la gran riqueza se lleva o destruyó.\nNo hay iglesias Bizantinas que sobrevivan a partir de este período; los miles de personas se mataron, y muchas ciudades – como Salames – se destruyeron y nunca se reconstruyeron. La regla bizantina se restauró en 965, cuando el emperador Nikephoros II Phokas marcó victorias decisivas en tierra y mar.\nEn 1191, durante la Tercera Cruzada, Richard I de Inglaterra capturó la isla de Isaac Komnenos de Chipre lo usó como una base de suministro principal que era relativamente segura de los Sarracenos. Un año más tarde Richard vendió la isla a los caballeros Templar, que, después de rebelión sangrienta, por su parte la vendieron al Tipo de Lusignan. Su hermano y el sucesor Amalric fueron reconocidos como el Rey de Chipre por Henry VI, Emperador romano Santo.\nDespués de muerte en 1473 de James II, el último rey de Lusignan, la república de Venecia asumió el control de la isla, mientras la viuda veneciana del rey fallecido, la reina Catherine Cornaro, reinó como el figurón de proa. Venecia formalmente anexó Chipre en 1489, después de abdicación de Catherine. Los venecianos fortificaron Nicosia construyendo las Paredes venecianas y la usaron como un cubo comercial importante. En todas partes del gobierno veneciano, el Imperio Otomano con frecuencia asaltaba Chipre. En 1539 los Otomanos destruyeron Limassol y entonces temiendo el peor, los venecianos también fortificaron Famagusta y Kyrenia.\nDurante los casi cuatro siglos del gobierno latino, allí existió dos sociedades en Chipre. El primer consistió en nobleza Fráncica y su séquito, así como comerciantes italianos y sus familias. El segundo, la mayoría de la población, consistió en chipriotas griegos, siervos y peones. Aunque un esfuerzo decidido se hiciera suplantar tradiciones natales y cultura, el esfuerzo fallado.\nEn 1570, un asalto del Otomano de gran escala con 60.000 tropas trajo la isla bajo el control del Otomano, a pesar de la resistencia tiesa por los habitantes de Nicosia y Famagusta. La élite latina anterior se destruyó y el primer cambio demográfico significativo ya que la antigüedad ocurrió cuando los Jenízaros del Otomano se colocaron en la isla. Las fuerzas del otomano capturando Chipre masacraron a muchos habitantes cristianos griegos y armenios.\nLos Otomanos abolieron el sistema feudal antes en el lugar y aplicaron el sistema de mijo a Chipre, bajo el cual los pueblos no musulmanes fueron gobernados por sus propias autoridades religiosas. En una inversión a partir de los días del gobierno latino, el jefe de la iglesia de Chipre se invirtió como el líder de la población chipriota griega y sirvió del mediador entre chipriotas griegos cristianos y las autoridades del Otomano. Este estado aseguró que la iglesia de Chipre estuviera en una posición para terminar las invasiones constantes de la Iglesia Católica Romana. El gobierno del otomano de Chipre era a veces indiferente, a veces opresivo, según los temperamentos de los sultanes y funcionarios locales, y la isla comenzó más de 250 años de la decadencia económica.\nEn 1828, el primer presidente de Grecia moderna Ioannis Kapodistrias cuyos antepasados maternos eran chipriotas griegos, llamó la unión de Chipre con Grecia, y ocurrieron los numerosos levantamientos menores. La reacción al mal gobierno del Otomano llevó a levantamientos tanto por chipriotas griegos como por turcos, aunque ninguno tuviera éxito. Hacia 1872, la población de la isla se había levantado a 144.000 comprensión de 44.000 musulmanes y 100.000 cristianos. Muchos de los musulmanes eran cristianos en secreto locales, llamados Linobambaki, que pretendían ser musulmanes en el día y se hacían cristianos otra vez por la noche. Esto se hizo a fin de evitar los impuestos suplementarios y otra discriminación contra cristianos, de los Otomanos. Los siglos del abandono por los turcos, la pobreza implacable de la mayor parte de la gente y los recaudadores de impuestos alguna vez presentes abastecieron de combustible el nacionalismo griego, y antes del 20mo siglo la idea de enosis, o la unión, con Grecia recién independiente firmemente se arraigó entre chipriotas griegos.\nChipre bajo el Imperio británico\nDespués de la guerra Russo-turca (1877–1878) y el Congreso de Berlín, Chipre se dio en arriendo al Imperio británico que de facto asumió a su administración en 1878 (aunque, en términos de soberanía, Chipre permaneciera un de jure territorio del Otomano hasta el 5 de noviembre de 1914, juntos con Egipto y Sudán) a cambio de garantías que Gran Bretaña usaría la isla como una base para proteger el Imperio Otomano contra la agresión rusa posible.\nLa isla serviría Gran Bretaña como una base militar clave para sus rutas coloniales. Hacia 1906, cuando el puerto de Famagusta se completó, Chipre era un puesto avanzado naval estratégico que pasa por alto el Canal de Suez, la ruta principal crucial a India que era la posesión extranjera entonces británica más importante. Después de brote de la Primera guerra mundial y la decisión del Imperio Otomano de afiliarse a la guerra contra el lado de los Poderes Centrales, el 5 de noviembre de 1914 el Imperio británico formalmente anexó Chipre y declaró el Otomano Khedivate de Egipto y Sudán un Sultanato y protectorado británico.\nEn 1915, Gran Bretaña ofreció Chipre a Constantine I de Grecia a condición de que Grecia se afilie a la guerra contra el lado de los británicos, que rehusó. En 1923, según el Tratado de Lausana, la república turca naciente abandonó cualquier reclamación de Chipre, y en 1925 se declaró una colonia de la corona británica. Muchos chipriotas griegos y turcos lucharon en el ejército británico durante ambas guerras mundiales. Durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial, muchos se alistaron en el Regimiento de Chipre.\nEn el enero de 1950, la iglesia de Chipre organizó un referéndum, que fue boicoteado por la comunidad chipriota turca, donde el 96% de griegos de Chipre votado a favor de \"enosis\", queriendo decir la unión con Grecia, Los griegos eran el 80,2% de la población de la isla total entonces (censo 1946). La autonomía restringida según una constitución fue propuesta por la administración británica, pero finalmente se rechazó. En 1955 la organización EOKA se fundó, buscando la independencia y la unión con Grecia a través de la lucha. Al mismo tiempo la Organización de Resistencia turca (TMT), llamando Taksim o partición, fue establecida por los chipriotas turcos como un contrapeso. La confusión a la isla fue encontrada con la fuerza por los británicos.\nEl 16 de agosto de 1960, Chipre alcanzó la independencia después de Zürich y Acuerdo de Londres entre el Reino Unido, Grecia y Turquía. Chipre tenía una población general de 573.566; de quien el 442,138 (el 77,1%) eran griegos, el 104,320 turcos (del 18,2%) y el 27,108 otros (del 4,7%) El Reino Unido retuvo las dos áreas Bajas Soberanas de Akrotiri y Dhekelia, mientras los puestos del gobierno y las oficinas públicas fueron asignados por cuotas étnicas, dando a los chipriotas turcos de la minoría un veto permanente, el 30% en el parlamento y dirección, y concediendo los tres derechos del garante de estados de la madre.\nEn 1963, la violencia intercomunal estalló, parcialmente patrocinada por ambas \"patrias\". Los chipriotas como consiguiente, turcos entraron en enclaves y el presidente chipriota arzobispo Makarios III pidió cambios constitucionales unilaterales como un medio de aliviar relaciones tensas sobre la isla entera. Las Naciones Unidas desplegaron fuerzas en Chipre (UNFICYP) en puntos de inflamación.\nEn 1964, Turquía trató de invadir Chipre en respuesta a la violencia intercomunal chipriota persistente. Pero Turquía fue parada por un telegrama fuertemente redactado del presidente estadounidense Lyndon B. Johnson el 5 de junio, advirtiendo que los EE.UU no estarían de pie al lado de Turquía en caso de una invasión soviética consiguiente del territorio turco.\nGolpe de 1974, invasión turca y división\nEl 15 de julio de 1974, la junta militar griega bajo Dimitrios Ioannides realizó un golpe de estado en Chipre, para unir la isla con Grecia. El golpe expulsó al presidente Makarios III y le sustituyó por el nacionalista pro-enosis Nikos Sampson. Cinco días más tarde, el 20 de julio de 1974, el ejército turco invadió una reclamación de la isla y pretender restaurar el pedido constitucional, de la república de Chipre reclamando un derecho de intervenir como uno de los garantes del Tratado de 1960 de la Garantía. El pedido constitucional nunca se restauró.\nLa fuerza aérea turca comenzó a bombardear posiciones griegas en Chipre, y cientos de tropas paracaidistas se dejaron caer en el área entre Nicosia y Kyrenia, donde los enclaves chipriotas turcos bien armados se habían mucho tiempo establecido; mientras de la costa de Kyrenia, los barcos de la tropa turcos consiguieron a 6.000 hombres así como tanques, camiones y vehículos blindados.\nTres días más tarde, cuando un alto el fuego se había concordado, Turquía había conseguido a 30.000 tropas a la isla y había capturado Kyrenia, el pasillo que une Kyrenia a Nicosia y cuarto chipriota turco de propia Nicosia. La junta en Atenas, y luego el régimen de Sampson en Chipre se cayeron del poder. En Nicosia, Glafkos Clerides asumió la presidencia y el pedido constitucional se restauró, quitando el pretexto para la invasión turca. Pero durante las negociaciones de paz en Ginebra, el gobierno turco reforzó su cabeza de puente de Kyrenia y se preparó para una segunda invasión. La invasión comenzó el 14 de agosto y causó el asimiento de Morphou, Karpass, Famagusta y Mesaoria.\nLa presión internacional llevó a un alto el fuego, y para entonces el 37% de la isla había sido asumido por los turcos y 180.000 chipriotas griegos se habían desalojado de sus casas en el norte. Al mismo tiempo, aproximadamente 50.000 chipriotas turcos se trasladaron a las áreas bajo el control de las Fuerzas turcas y se instalaron las propiedades de los chipriotas griegos desplazados. Entre una variedad de sanciones contra Turquía, a mediados de 1975 el Congreso estadounidense impuso un embargo de armas sobre Turquía para usar el equipo provisto por los americanos durante la invasión turca de Chipre en 1974.\nPostdivisión\nDespués de la restauración del pedido constitucional y la vuelta del arzobispo Makarios III a Chipre en el diciembre de 1974, las tropas turcas permanecieron, ocupando la parte noreste de la isla. En 1983, el líder de chipriotas turcos proclamó la república turca de Chipre del Norte (TRNC), que sólo es reconocido por Turquía. Hay 1.534 chipriotas griegos y 502 chipriotas turcos que fallan a consecuencia de los enfrentamientos.\nLos eventos del verano de 1974 dominan la política a la isla, así como relaciones Greco-turcas. Se cree que aproximadamente 150.000 pobladores de Turquía viven en el norte mucho del cual fueron forzados de Turquía por el gobierno turco - en la violación de la Convención de Ginebra y varias resoluciones de las Naciones Unidas. Después de invasión y la captura de su Territorio del Norte por tropas turcas, la república de Chipre anunció que todos sus puertos de entrada en el norte se cerraron, ya que no estaban con eficacia bajo su control.\nLa invasión turca y la ocupación y la declaración de independencia del TRNC han sido condenadas por varias resoluciones de las Naciones Unidas. El Consejo de Seguridad reafirma esto cada año. El último gran esfuerzo colocar la disputa de Chipre era el Plan de Annan en 2004, redactado por de entonces Secretario general, Kofi Annan. El plan se puso a un referéndum tanto en llamado TRNC como en la república de Chipre. El 65% de chipriotas turcos votó en apoyo del plan y chipriotas griegos del 74% votados contra el plan, quien percibió que esto favorecía desproporcionadamente a turcos.\nEn total, el 66,7% de los votantes, tanto chipriotas griegos como turcos, rechazó el Plan V de Annan\nEl 1 de mayo de 2004 Chipre se afilió a la Unión Europea, juntos con otros nueve países. Chipre se aceptó en la UE en conjunto, aunque la legislación de la UE se suspenda en el territorio ocupado por Turquía (TRNC), hasta una liquidación final del problema de Chipre. En el julio de 2006, la isla sirvió de un asilo para la gente que huye de Líbano, debido al conflicto entre Israel y Hezbollah (también llamado \"La guerra de julio\").\nEn el marzo de 2008, una pared que había estado de pie durante décadas en el límite entre la república de Chipre y la zona de amortiguación de las Naciones Unidas se demolió. La pared había cortado a través de Ledra Street en el corazón de Nicosia y se vio como un símbolo fuerte de la división de 32 años de la isla. El 3 de abril de 2008, Ledra Street se volvió a abrir en la presencia de funcionarios chipriotas griegos y turcos.\nChipre es la tercera isla más grande en el Mar Mediterráneo, después de las islas italianas de Sicilia y Cerdeña (tanto en términos de área como en términos de población). También es el 81er más grande del mundo por el área y del mundo el 51er más grande por la población. Mide mucho tiempo de juntando los dos extremos y amplio a su punto más amplio, con Turquía al norte. Sale mintiendo entre latitudes 34 ° y 36 ° N, y longitudes 32 ° y 35 ° E.\nOtros territorios vecinos incluyen Siria y Líbano al este (respectivamente), Israel al sudeste, Egipto al sur y Grecia al noroeste: a la pequeña isla de Dodecanesian de Kastellorizo (Megisti), a Rhodes y al continente griego.\nEl alivio físico de la isla es dominado por dos sierras, las Montañas Troodos y la Variedad de Kyrenia más pequeña y la llanura central que cercan, Mesaoria. La llanura Mesaoria es drenada por el Río Pedieos, el más largo a la isla. Las Montañas Troodos cubren la mayor parte de las partes del sur y occidentales de la isla y explican aproximadamente la mitad de su área. El punto más alto en Chipre es Monte Olimpo en, localizado en el centro del grupo de Troodos. La Variedad de Kyrenia estrecha, que se extiende a lo largo del litoral del norte, ocupa considerablemente menos área, y las elevaciones son más bajas, alcanzando un máximo de.\nGeopolíticamente, la isla se subdivide en cuatro segmentos principales. La república de Chipre ocupa las dos terceras partes del sur de la isla (el 59,74%). La república turca de Chipre del Norte ocupa el tercero del norte (el 34,85%), y la Línea Verde controlada por las Naciones Unidas proporciona una zona de amortiguación que separa los dos y cubre el 2,67% de la isla. Finalmente, dos bases bajo la soberanía británica se localizan a la isla: Akrotiri y Dhekelia, cubriendo el 2,74% restante.\nChipre tiene un clima subtropical – tipo Mediterráneo y semiárido (en la parte noreste de la isla) – clasificaciones del clima de Köppen Csa y Bsh, con inviernos muy suaves (en la costa) y caliente a veranos calientes. La nieve sólo es posible en las Montañas Troodos en la parte central de la isla. La lluvia ocurre principalmente en invierno, con el verano siendo generalmente seca.\nChipre tiene el clima más caliente (y los inviernos más calientes) en la parte Mediterránea de la Unión Europea. La temperatura anual media en la costa está alrededor durante el día y por la noche. Generalmente, los veranos duran aproximadamente ocho meses, que comienzan en abril con temperaturas medias de durante el día y por la noche y terminan en noviembre con temperaturas medias de durante el día y por la noche, aunque en las temperaturas de cuatro meses restantes a veces excedan.\nEntre todas las ciudades en la parte Mediterránea de la Unión Europea, Limassol tiene los inviernos más calientes, en el enero del período – la temperatura de promedio del febrero es durante el día y por la noche, en otras ubicaciones costeras en Chipre es generalmente durante el día y por la noche. En marzo y diciembre en el promedio de Limassol las temperaturas son durante el día y por la noche, en otras ubicaciones costeras en Chipre es generalmente durante el día y por la noche.\nEl medio del verano está caliente – en julio y agosto en la costa que la temperatura media está por lo general alrededor durante el día y alrededor por la noche (dentro de la isla, en el promedio de tierras altas que la temperatura excede) mientras en el junio y septiembre en la costa la temperatura media está por lo general alrededor durante el día y alrededor por la noche. Las fluctuaciones grandes en la temperatura son raras. Las temperaturas dentro de la isla son más rigurosas, con inviernos más fríos y veranos más calientes comparado con la costa de la isla.\nLa temperatura anual media del mar es, de en febrero a en agosto (según la ubicación). En 7 meses totales – de mayo a noviembre – la temperatura de mar media excede.\nLas horas de luz del sol en la costa son aproximadamente 3.400 por año, de un promedio de 5–6 horas de la luz del sol por día en diciembre a un promedio de 12–13 horas en julio. Esto es sobre el doble esa de ciudades en la mitad del norte de Europa; para la comparación, Londres recibe aproximadamente 1.461 por año. En diciembre, Londres recibe aproximadamente 37 horas de la luz del sol mientras ubicaciones costeras en Chipre aproximadamente 180 horas (es decir tanto como en mayo en Londres).\nChipre sufre de una escasez del agua. El país confía pesadamente en la lluvia para proporcionar el agua doméstica, y durante muchos años ahora parece que la precipitación anual media disminuye. Entre 2001 y 2004, la precipitación anual excepcionalmente pesada hizo subir reservas acuáticas, con la demanda de excediendo de suministro, permitiendo el almacenaje total en los embalses de la isla elevarse a un nivel más alto absoluto por el principio de 2005.\nSin embargo, desde entonces la demanda ha aumentado anualmente – un resultado del crecimiento de la población local, extranjeros que se trasladan a Chipre y el número de visitar a turistas – mientras el suministro se ha caído. Chipre tiene un total de 107 presas (más una actualmente bajo la construcción) y embalses, con una capacidad de memoria acuática total de aproximadamente.\nLas presas permanecen la fuente principal del agua tanto para el uso doméstico como agrícola. Las plantas de desalación acuáticas se están gradualmente construyendo para tratar con años recientes de la sequía prolongada.\nEl Gobierno ha invertido pesadamente en la creación de plantas de desalación acuáticas que han suministrado casi el 50 por ciento de agua doméstica desde 2001. Los esfuerzos también se han hecho levantar la sensibilización de la opinión pública de la situación y animar a usuarios acuáticos domésticos a tomar más responsabilidad de la conservación de esta materia cada vez más escasa.\nTurquía construye un conducto acuático bajo el Mar Mediterráneo de Anamur en su costa del sur a la costa del norte de Chipre, para suministrar Chipre del Norte del agua de riego y potable (ver el Proyecto del Abastecimiento de agua de Chipre del Norte).\nChipre es una república presidencial. El jefe de estado y del gobierno es elegido por un proceso del sufragio universal para un término de cinco años. El poder ejecutivo es ejercido por el gobierno con el poder legislativo investido en la Cámara de Representantes mientras la Judicatura es independiente tanto del ejecutivo como de la legislatura.\nLa Constitución de 1960 aseguró un sistema presidencial del gobierno con poderes judiciales y ejecutivos, legislativos independientes así como un sistema complejo de frenos y contrapesos incluso una proporción del compartimiento del poder ponderada diseñada para proteger los intereses de los chipriotas turcos. El ejecutivo fue conducido por un presidente chipriota griego y un vicepresidente chipriota turco elegido por sus comunidades respectivas para términos de cinco años y cada posesión de un derecho de veto sobre ciertos tipos de legislación y decisiones ejecutivas. El poder legislativo se apoyó en la Cámara de Representantes quienes también se eligieron sobre la base de los rollos de los votantes separados.\nDesde 1965, choques siguientes entre las dos comunidades, los asientos chipriotas turcos en la Casa permanecen vacantes. Los chipriotas turcos rechazaron establecer la situación antes de la invasión de Chipre como es evidente en el Secretario general de las Naciones Unidas que dijo que \"Los líderes chipriotas turcos se han adherido a un soporte rígido contra cualquier medida que podría implicar tener miembros de las dos comunidades vivas y trabajar juntos, o que podría colocar a chipriotas turcos en situaciones donde tendrían que reconocer la autoridad de agentes del Gobierno. En efecto, ya que el mando chipriota turco está dedicado a la separación física y geográfica de las comunidades como un objetivo político, probablemente no animará actividades por chipriotas turcos que se pueden interpretar como la demostración de los méritos de una política alternativa. Hacia 1974 las dos comunidades habían vuelto a un estado más tolerante de la vida.\nEn 1974 Chipre se dividió de facto cuando el ejército turco ocupó el tercero del norte de la isla. Los chipriotas turcos posteriormente declararon la independencia en 1983 como la república turca de Chipre del Norte, pero sólo fueron reconocidos por Turquía. En 1985 el TRNC adoptó una constitución y sostuvo sus primeras elecciones. Las Naciones Unidas reconocen la soberanía de la república de Chipre sobre la isla entera de Chipre.\nLa Cámara de Representantes actualmente tiene 59 miembros elegidos para un término de cinco años, 56 miembros por la representación proporcional y 3 miembros del observador que representan las minorías armenias, latinas y maronitas. 24 asientos se asignan a la comunidad turca, pero permanecen vacantes desde 1964. El ambiente político es dominado por AKEL comunista, la Reunión democrática conservadora liberal, el Partido demócrata centrista, EDEK socialdemócrata y el centrista EURO.KO.\nEn 2008, Dimitris Christofias se hizo el primer jefe de estado comunista del país. Debido a su participación en la 2012–13 crisis financiera chipriota, Christofias no corrió a la reelección en 2013. Las Elecciones presidenciales en 2013 causaron al candidato de Rally democrático Nicos Anastasiades que gana el 57,48% del voto. Como consiguiente, Anastasiades se tomó juramento en y ha sido el presidente desde el 28 de febrero de 2013.\nLa república de Chipre se divide en seis distritos: Nicosia, Famagusta, Kyrenia, Larnaca, Limassol y Paphos.\nExclaves y enclaves\nChipre tiene cuatro exclaves, todos en el territorio que pertenece al área Baja Soberana británica de Dhekelia. Los primeros dos son los pueblos de Ormidhia y Xylotymvou. El tercer es la Central eléctrica Dhekelia que es dividida en un camino británico en dos partes. La parte del norte es un exclave, como los dos pueblos, mientras que la parte del sur es localizada por el mar y por lo tanto no un exclave aunque no tenga aguas territoriales de su propio.\nLa zona de amortiguación de las Naciones Unidas corre contra Dhekelia y recoge otra vez de sus barrios este de Nueva York de Ayios Nikolaos y es relacionada con el resto de Dhekelia por un pasillo de la tierra delgado. En ese sentido la zona de amortiguación gira el área de Paralimni en la esquina del sudeste de la isla en un de facto, aunque no de jure, exclave.\nLa república de Chipre es un miembro de los grupos internacionales siguientes: Australia Group, CN, CE, CFSP, EBRD, EIB, la UE, FAO, OIEA, Banco Internacional de Reconstrucción y Fomento, ICAO, ICC, ICCt, ITUC, IDA, IFAD, CFI, IHO, OIT, FMI, IMO, Interpol, IOC, IOM, IPU, ITU, MIGA, NAM, NSG, OPCW, la OSCE, PCA, las Naciones Unidas, UNCTAD, UNESCO, UNHCR, UNIDO, UPU, WCL, WCO, WFTU, QUIEN, WIPO, WMO, WToO, OMC.\nEn \"La libertad en el mundo 2011\", la Casa de Libertad tasó la democracia de Chipre como \"libre\". La atención constante a la división de la isla puede enmascarar a veces otras cuestiones de derechos humanos. La prostitución se ha descrito como abundante tanto en la república de Chipre como en las regiones controladas por el turco que llevan a la crítica del gobierno de los Estados Unidos para su carencia presunta de mandos del comercio sexual y para el papel de Chipre como uno de los destinos principales para el tráfico humano de Europa Oriental.\nEl asesinato reciente del músico izquierdista Pavlos Fyssas en Atenas, Grecia, según se afirma por un militante del Alba de Oro, despierta preocupaciones en Chipre que el extremismo creciente no se está suficientemente dirigiendo en el país. El ministro de justicia, Ionas Nicolaou, confesó que la policía chipriota investigaría el material de racista, xenophobic y actividades extremistas que ocurren en el país, incluso pruebas presuntas que armaron los ejercicios militares se estaban realizando en campos de verano para la juventud.\nLa Guardia Nacional chipriota es la institución militar principal de la república de Chipre. Es una fuerza de armas combinada, con tierra, aire y elementos navales. La Guardia Nacional es un servicio de 24 meses requerido para todos los hombres para completar su 17mo cumpleaños. Las fuerzas terrestres de la Guardia Nacional chipriota comprenden las unidades siguientes:\nPrimera división de la infantería (??  ??)\nSegunda división de la infantería (??a  ??)\nCuarta brigada de la infantería (?V?  ??)\nVeinte brigada blindada (??? ?T )\nTercera brigada de apoyo (????  ??)\nOctava brigada de apoyo (VIII?  ??)\nLa fuerza aérea incluye el 449no Escuadrón de la Nave armada del Helicóptero (449 ???) – haciendo funcionar SA-342L y Bell 206 y el 450mo Escuadrón de la Nave armada del Helicóptero (450 ME/P) – Mi-35P de operaciones, MIL MILLONES 2B y PC 9. Los Oficiales de alta graduación corrientes incluyen a Comandante Supremo, Guardia Nacional chipriota, el Tte general Stylianos Nasis, y Jefe de Estado Mayor, Guardia Nacional chipriota: Maj. El general Mihalis Flerianos.\nLa explosión de la Base naval Evangelos Florakis estaba el accidente de militares del tiempo de paz peor alguna vez registrado en Chipre. El incidente ocurrió el 11 de julio de 2011.\nLa economía chipriota tiene diversificado y hágase próspero en años recientes. Sin embargo, en 2012 se hizo afectado por la Eurozona crisis financiera y bancaria. En el junio de 2012, el gobierno chipriota anunció que necesitaría el € de la ayuda externa apoyar el Chipre Banco Popular, y esto fue seguido de Fitch que degrada la clasificación crediticia de Chipre para desechar el estado. Fitch dijo que Chipre necesitaría un € adicional para apoyar sus bancos y la bajada era principalmente debido a la exposición de Banco de Chipre, Chipre Banco Popular y Banco helénico, los tres bancos más grandes de Chipre, a la crisis financiera griega.\nLa 2012–2013 crisis financiera chipriota llevó a un acuerdo con el Eurogrupo en el marzo de 2013 para partir el segundo banco más grande del país, el Chipre Banco Popular (también conocido como el Banco de Laiki), en un banco \"malo\" que se bajaría con el tiempo y un banco \"bueno\" que sería absorbido por el Banco de Chipre. A cambio de un desalojo urgente de €10 mil millones de la Comisión Europea, el Banco central europeo y el Fondo Monetario Internacional, se requeriría que el gobierno chipriota imponga un corte de pelo significativo a depósitos no asegurados, una proporción grande de los cuales fueron sostenidos por rusos ricos que usaron Chipre como un paraíso fiscal. Los depósitos asegurados de 100,000€ o menos no se afectarían.\nSegún las últimas estimaciones del Fondo Monetario Internacional, su per cápita el PIB (ajustado para el poder adquisitivo) en 28.381$ está sólo encima del promedio de la Unión Europea. Chipre se ha buscado como una base varios negocios de la costa para sus tasas impositivas bajas. El turismo, los servicios financieros y el embarque son partes significativas de la economía.\nLa política económica del gobierno de Chipre se ha concentrado en encontrar los criterios para la admisión a la Unión Europea. El gobierno chipriota adoptó el euro como la moneda nacional el 1 de enero de 2008.\nEn años recientes las cantidades significativas de gas natural de la costa se han descubierto en el área conocida como Afrodita en la zona económica exclusiva (EEZ) de Chipre, sobre el sur de Limassol en 33°5'40?N y 32°59'0?E. Sin embargo, las compañías de perforación de la costa de Turquía han tenido acceso tanto a gas natural como a recursos de petróleo desde 2013. Chipre demarcó su frontera marítima con Egipto en 2003, y con Líbano en 2007. Chipre e Israel demarcaron su frontera marítima en 2010, y en el agosto de 2011, la firma estadounidense Noble Energy firmó un acuerdo que comparte la producción con el gobierno chipriota en cuanto al desarrollo comercial del bloque.\nTurquía, que no reconoce los acuerdos fronterizos de Chipre con sus vecinos, amenazó con movilizar sus fuerzas navales en caso de que Chipre siguiera con proyectos de comenzar a perforar en el Bloque 12. Los esfuerzos de perforación de Chipre tienen el apoyo de los EE.UU, la UE, y las Naciones Unidas, y el 19 de septiembre de 2011 perforando en el Bloque 12 comenzaron sin cualquier incidente relatado.\nLa isla ha atestiguado un crecimiento masivo del turismo durante los años y como tal el mercado del alquiler de la propiedad en Chipre ha crecido. Añadido a esto es el aumento de capital en la propiedad que se ha creado de la demanda de inversionistas entrantes y compradores de la propiedad a la isla. A finales de 2013, el Departamento del Urbanismo de Chipre anunció una serie de incentivos para ayudar a encender el mercado inmobiliario y crecimiento de paseo adicional del desarrollo de la propiedad recientemente construido en centros de la ciudad a través del país. Esto siguió medidas más tempranas para permisos de inmigración nuevos y más rápidos a ciudadanos de terceros países que invierten en la propiedad de Chipre.\nLos modos disponibles del transporte son por camino, mar y aire. Del de caminos en la república de Chipre en 1998, se pavimentaron y eran sin pavimentar. En 1996 el área ocupada por el turco tenía una proporción similar del pavimentado al sin pavimentar, con aproximadamente del camino pavimentado y sin pavimentar. Chipre es una de sólo cuatro naciones de la UE en las cuales los vehículos conducen a la izquierda del camino, un remanente de la colonización británica (los demás que son Irlanda, Malta y el Reino Unido).\nHay varias autopistas modernas en Chipre. Una serie de autopistas corre a lo largo de la costa de Paphos al este a Ayia Napa, con dos autopistas que corren tierra adentro a Nicosia, un de Limassol y un de Larnaca.\nA1 Nicosia a Limassol\nA2 une A1 cerca de Pera Chorio con A3 por Larnaca\nA3 Larnaca a Agia Napa\nA5 une A1 cerca de Kofinou con A3 por Larnaca\nA6 Pafos a Limassol\nA9 Nicosia a Astromeritis\nLa propiedad de coches per cápita privada es la 29na más alta en el mundo. Había aproximadamente 344.000 vehículos privados y un total de 517.000 automóviles certificados en la república de Chipre en 2006. En 2006 los proyectos extensos se anunciaron para mejorar y ampliar servicios del autobús y reestructurar el transporte público en todas partes de Chipre, con el respaldo financiero del Banco de desarrollo de la Unión Europea. En 2010 la nueva red del autobús revisada y ampliada se puso en práctica.\nChipre tiene varios helipuertos y dos aeropuertos internacionales: aeropuerto internacional de Larnaca y aeropuerto internacional Paphos. Un tercer aeropuerto, el aeropuerto internacional de Ercan funciona en el área administrada chipriota turca con vuelos directos sólo a Turquía (los puertos chipriotas turcos se cierran al tráfico internacional aparte de Turquía). El aeropuerto internacional de Nicosia se ha cerrado desde 1974.\nLos puertos principales de la isla son Limassol y Larnaca, que la carga del servicio, el pasajero y el crucero transportan.\nCyta, la empresa de telecomunicaciones nacional, maneja la mayor parte de telecomunicaciones y conexiones a internet a la isla. Sin embargo, después de liberalización reciente del sector, unas empresas de telecomunicaciones privadas han surgido incluso MTN, Cablenet, Telecomunicaciones de OTEnet, Telecomunicaciones de la Omega y PrimeTel. En el área controlada por el turco de Chipre, tres compañías también están presentes: Turkcell, KKTC Telsim y turco Telekom.\nSegún el mundo de la CIA Factbook, en 2001 los chipriotas griegos comprendieron el 77%, chipriotas turcos el 18% y otros el 5% de la población chipriota. En el momento del censo del gobierno de 2011, había 10.520 personas del origen ruso que vive en Chipre.\nSegún el primer censo demográfico después de la declaración de independencia, realizada en el diciembre de 1960 y cubierta de la isla entera, Chipre tenía una población general de 573.566; de quien el 442,138 (el 77,1%) eran griegos, el 104,320 turco (del 18,2%) y el 27,108 otros (del 4,7%).\nDebido a las relaciones tensas étnicas intercomunales entre 1963 y 1974, un censo por toda la isla se consideró como imposible. Sin embargo, los chipriotas griegos condujeron el que en 1973, sin el pueblo chipriota turco. Según este censo, la población chipriota griega era 482,000. Un año más tarde, en 1974, el Departamento del gobierno chipriota de Estadística e Investigación estimó la población general de Chipre en 641.000; de quien el 506,000 (el 78,9%) eran griegos y el 118,000 turco (del 18,4%). Después de la partición de la isla en 1974, los griegos condujeron más cuatro censuses: en 1976, 1982, 1992 y 2001; éstos excluyeron a la población turca que era el residente en la parte del norte de la isla.\nSegún la república de la última estimación de Chipre, en 2005, el número de ciudadanos chipriotas que actualmente viven en la república de Chipre es aproximadamente 871.036. Además de esto, la república de Chipre es patria de 110.200 residentes permanentes extranjeros y aproximadamente 10.000-30.000 inmigrantes ilegales indocumentados que actualmente viven en el sur de la isla.\nSegún el censo de 2006 realizado por Chipre del Norte, había 256,644 (de jure) la gente que vive en Chipre del Norte. 178,031 eran ciudadanos de Chipre del Norte, de quien 147,405 nacieron en Chipre (112,534 desde el norte; 32,538 desde el sur; 371 no indicó que parte de Chipre eran de); 27.333 nacidos en Turquía; 2.482 nacidos en el Reino Unido y 913 nacidos en Bulgaria. De los 147.405 ciudadanos nacidos en Chipre, 120,031 dicen que ambos padres nacieron en Chipre; 16,824 dicen a ambos padres nacidos en Turquía; 10,361 hacen llevar a un padre en Turquía y un padre nacido en Chipre.\nEn 2010, International Crisis Group estimó que la población general de Chipre era 1,1 millones, de los cuales había aproximadamente 300.000 residentes en el norte, quizás mitad de quien o se nacieron en Turquía o son hijos de tales pobladores. Una fuente afirma que la población en el norte ha alcanzado 500,000, se piensa que el 50% de que es pobladores turcos o hijos de origen chipriota de tales pobladores.\nLos pueblos de Potamia (el distrito de Nicosia) y Pyla en el Distrito de Larnaca son los únicos establecimientos en la república de Chipre con una población chipriota griega y turca variada.\nEl Y-ADN haplogroups se encuentra en las frecuencias siguientes en Chipre: J (el 43,07% incluso J1 del 6,20%), 1b1 mil millones de euros (el 20,00%), R1 (el 12,30% incluso R1b del 9,2%), F (el 9,20%), yo (el 7,70%), K (el 4,60%), (el 3,10%). Los J, K, F y 1b1 mil millones de euros haplogroups consisten en linajes con la distribución diferencial dentro de Oriente Medio, África del Norte y Europa mientras R1 y yo somos típicos en poblaciones europeas de Oeste.\nFuera de Chipre hay una diáspora chipriota griega significativa y próspera y la diáspora chipriota turca en el Reino Unido, Australia, Canadá, los Estados Unidos, Grecia y Turquía.\nLa mayoría de chipriotas griegos se identifica como el Ortodoxo griego, mientras que la mayor parte de chipriotas turcos son adherentes del Islam sunita. Según el Eurobarómetro 2005, Chipre es el segundo estado más religioso en la Unión Europea, después de Malta (ver la Religión en la Unión Europea). El primer presidente de Chipre, Makarios III, era un arzobispo. El líder corriente de la Iglesia Ortodoxa griega de Chipre es el arzobispo Chrysostomos II\nHala Sultan Tekke, situado cerca de la Larnaca Salt Lake, es considerado por algunos orientalistas seculares como el tercer sitio más lleno de agujeros en el Islam sunita y un objeto de la peregrinación tanto para musulmanes como para cristianos.\nSegún el censo de 2001 realizado en el área controlada por el Gobierno, el 94,8% de la población es Ortodoxo del Este, armenios del 0,9% y maronitas, Católicos del 1,5%, iglesia del 1,0% de Inglaterra y musulmanes del 0,6%. El 1,3% restante se adhiere a otras denominaciones religiosas o no declaró su religión.\nChipre tiene dos idiomas oficiales, griego y turco. Árabe maronita armenio y chipriota se reconoce como lenguas de la minoría. Aunque sin el estado oficial, inglés extensamente se diga. Rasgos ingleses en señales de tráfico, atenciones públicas, y en la publicidad, etc. inglés era el único idioma oficial durante gobierno colonial británico y lengua franca (hasta 1960) y siguió usándose (de facto) en cortes hasta 1989 y en la legislatura hasta 1996. El 80,4% relatado de chipriotas tiene el dominio de la lengua inglesa como la segunda lengua (L2). Ruso extensamente se dice entre minorías del país, residentes y ciudadanos de países postsoviéticos, así como griegos Pontic. Se usa y dicho por aproximadamente 100.000 personas, incluso rusos, ucranianos, Belarusians, armenios, griegos de Pontic, georgianos y búlgaros. Ruso, después de inglés y griego, es la tercera lengua usada en muchos signos de tiendas y restaurantes, en particular en Limassol y Paphos. Además de estas lenguas, el 12% habla francés y el 5% habla alemán.\nEl lenguaje hablado diario de chipriotas griegos es griego chipriota y ese de chipriotas turcos es turco chipriota. Éstos ambos se diferencian de su registro estándar respectivo completamente considerablemente.\nChipre tiene un sistema muy desarrollado de la educación secundaria y primaria que ofrece la educación tanto pública como privada. La alta calidad de instrucción se puede atribuir en parte al hecho que casi el 7% del PIB se gasta para la educación que hace Chipre uno de los tres primeros gastadores de la educación en la UE junto con Dinamarca y Suecia.\nLas escuelas estatales generalmente se ven como equivalentes en la calidad de la educación a instituciones del sector privado. Sin embargo, el valor de un diploma de escuela secundaria estatal es limitado por el hecho que los grados obtuvieron la cuenta para sólo aproximadamente el 25% del grado final para cada tema, con el 75% restante asignado por el profesor durante el semestre, de un modo mínimamente transparente. Las universidades chipriotas (como universidades en Grecia) no hacen caso de grados de la escuela secundaria casi completamente con objetivos de admisiones. Mientras un diploma de escuela secundaria es obligatorio para la asistencia universitaria, las admisiones se deciden casi exclusivamente sobre la base de tanteos en exámenes del acceso a la universidad centralmente administrados que se requiere que todos los candidatos universitarios tomen.\nLa mayoría de chipriotas recibe su enseñanza superior en griego, británicos, turco, otras universidades europeas y norteamericanas. Es significativo que Chipre actualmente tiene el porcentaje más alto de ciudadanos de la edad trabajadora que tienen la educación de nivel más alto en la UE en el 30% que está delante del 29,5% de Finlandia. Además, el 47% de su población de edad 25–34 tiene la educación terciaria, que es la más alta en la UE. El cuerpo de estudiantes chipriotas es muy móvil, con el 78,7% que estudia en una universidad fuera de Chipre.\nLa cultura de Chipre se divide entre las dos culturas distintas de chipriotas griegos y turcos. Cada comunidad mantiene su propia cultura, unida a las culturas de Grecia y Turquía, y hay poco intercambio cultural entre los dos grupos. La cultura griega ha estado presente a la isla desde la antigüedad. La cultura turca llegó con la invasión del Imperio Otomano en 1570. El gobierno británico dejó la isla todavía dividida sin la cultura unificada.\nSe puede decir que la historia del arte de Chipre estira atrás hasta 10.000 años, después de descubrimiento de una serie de las cifras esculpidas del período de Chalcolithic en los pueblos de Khoirokoitia y Lempa. La isla es la casa a numerosos ejemplos del icono religioso de alta calidad que pinta a partir de la Edad media así como muchas iglesias pintadas. La arquitectura chipriota era pesadamente bajo la influencia del renacimiento gótico e italiano francés introducido en la isla durante la era de la dominación latina (1191–1571).\nEn tiempos modernos la historia del arte chipriota comienza con el pintor Vassilis Vryonides (1883–1958) quien estudió en la Academia de Bellas artes en Venecia. Posiblemente los dos padres fundadores del arte chipriota moderno eran Adamantios Diamantis (1900–1994) quien estudió en el Colegio Real de Londres del Arte y Christopheros Savva (1924–1968) quien también estudió en Londres, en la Escuela de San Martín del Arte. Desde muchos puntos de vista estos dos artistas ponen la plantilla para el arte chipriota subsecuente y tanto sus estilos artísticos como los modelos de su educación permanecen influyentes hasta este día. En particular la mayoría de artistas chipriotas todavía se entrena en Inglaterra mientras los otros se entrenan en escuelas de arte en Grecia e instituciones de arte locales como el Colegio de Chipre del Arte, la universidad de Nicosia y el Instituto de Frederick de la Tecnología.\nUno de los rasgos del arte chipriota es una tendencia hacia la pintura figurada aunque el arte conceptual esté siendo rigurosamente promovido por varias \"instituciones\" de arte y el más notablemente la Nicosia Centro de Arte Municipal http://www .nimac.com.cy/. Las galerías de arte municipales existen en todas las ciudades principales y hay una escena del arte publicitario grande y animada. Chipre era debido de recibir el festival de arte internacional Manifesta en 2006 pero esto se anuló en el último momento después de disputa entre los organizadores holandeses de Manifesta y el Ministerio de Educación de Chipre y Cultura sobre la ubicación de algunos acontecimientos de Manifesta en el sector turco de la capital Nicosia.\nOtros artistas chipriotas notables incluyen a Rhea Bailey, Mihail Kkasialos, Ioannis Kissonergis, Theodoulos Gregoriou, Helene Black, George Skoteinos, familia de Kalopedis, Panayiotis Kalorkoti, Nicos Nicolaides, Stass Paraskos, Arestís Stasí, Telemachos Kanthos, Konstantia Sofokleous y Chris Achilleos.\nLa música folklórica tradicional de Chipre tiene varios elementos comunes con griego, turco y música árabe incluso bailes Greco-turcos como el sousta, syrtos, zeibekikos, tatsia, y karsilamas así como tsifteteli inspirado del Medio Oriente y arapies. También hay una forma de la poesía musical conocida como chattista que a menudo se realiza en banquetes tradicionales y celebraciones. Los instrumentos comúnmente asociados con la música folklórica de Chipre son el bouzouki, oud (\"outi\"), violín (\"fkiolin\"), sellan (\"laouto\"), acordeón, flauta de Chipre (\"pithkiavlin\") y percusión (incluso el \"toumperleki\"). Los compositores asociados con la música chipriota tradicional incluyen Evagoras Karageorgis, Marios Tokas, Solon Michaelides y Savvas Salides. Entre músicos también es el pianista aclamado Cyprien Katsaris.\nLa música popular en Chipre es generalmente bajo la influencia de la escena Laïka griega; los artistas que juegan en este género incluyen la estrella platino internacional Anna Vissi, Evridiki y Sarbel. El hip-hop, R&B y reggae ha sido apoyado por la aparición del golpe chipriota y la escena de la música urbana en Ayia Napa. La roca de Éntekhno y la música de rock chipriota a menudo tiene que ver con artistas como Michalis Hatzigiannis y Alkinoos Ioannidis. El metal también tiene pequeño lo siguiente en Chipre representado por grupos como el Armagedón (el Rev 16:16), Blynd, el Borde del Invierno y Cuadrafónico.\nLa producción literaria de la antigüedad incluye Cypria, una poema épica, probablemente tranquila a finales del 7mo siglo A.C. y atribuida a Stasinus. El Cypria es uno de los primeros especímenes de la poesía griega y europea. Zeno chipriota de Citium era el fundador de la Escuela Estoica de la Filosofía.\nLa poesía épica, notablemente el \"acritic canciones\", prosperó durante la Edad media. Dos crónicas, una escrita por Leontios Machairas y otro por Georgios Voustronios, cubren la Edad media entera hasta el final de la regla Fráncica (el 4to siglo 1489). Poèmes d'amour escritos en el chipriota griego medieval se remontan a partir del 16to siglo. Algunos de ellos son traducciones actuales de poemas escritos por Petrarch, Bembo, Ariosto y G. Sannazzaro. Muchos eruditos chipriotas huyeron de Chipre en tiempos preocupados como Ioannis Kigalas (c. 1622–1687) quien emigró de Chipre a Italia en el 17mo siglo, varios de sus trabajos han sobrevivido en libros de otros eruditos.\nHasan Hilmi Efendi, un poeta chipriota turco, fue recompensado por el sultán del Otomano Mahmud II y dijo ser el \"sultán de los poemas\".\nLas cifras literarias modernas de Chipre incluyen al poeta y el escritor Kostas Montis, el poeta Kyriakos Charalambides, el poeta Michalis Pasiardis, el escritor Nicos Nicolaides, Stylianos Atteshlis, Altheides, Loukis Akritas y Demetris Th. Gotsis. Dimitris Lipertis, Vasilis Michaelides y Pavlos Liasides son poetas populares que escribieron poemas principalmente en el dialecto chipriota-griego. Lawrence Durrell vivió en Chipre del Norte de 1952 al 26 de agosto de 1956 y escribió el libro Limones Amargos acerca de su tiempo allí que ganó el segundo Premio de Duff Cooper en 1957. La mayoría del juego Otelo de William Shakespeare se pone a la isla de Chipre. Chipre también figura en la literatura religiosa como los Hechos de los Apóstoles según los cuales los Apóstoles Barnabas y Paul predicaron a la isla.\nEl director chipriota más renombrado para haber trabajado en el extranjero es Michael Cacoyannis.\nEl cine chipriota nació mucho más tarde que ese de otros países. A finales de los años 1960 y a principios de los años 1970, George Filis produjo y dirigió Gregoris Afxentiou, Etsi Prodothike i Kypros (Traición de Chipre), y El Documento Súper.\nEn 1994, la producción cinematográfica recibió un aumento con el establecimiento del Comité asesor del Cine. Desde el año 2000, la cantidad anual puesta aparte en el presupuesto nacional está de pie en Cy Pounds 500,000 (aproximadamente 850.000 euros). Además de subvenciones del gobierno, las coproducciones chipriotas son elegibles para financiar del Consejo del Fondo Eurimages de Europa, que financia coproducciones de la película europeas. Hasta ahora, cuatro películas de largometraje en las cuales un chipriota era el productor ejecutivo han recibido la financiación de Eurimages. El primer era yo Sphagi tou Kokora (1992), completado en 1996, Hellados (Y la Mosca de Trenes al Cielo, 1995), que está actualmente en postproducción y estaño de Dromos gia O de Costas Demetriou Ithaki (El Camino hacia Ithaka, 1997) que premiered en el marzo de 2000.

{"text": "LIMPET Self-Sink Air Hose is a brand new, reinforced air delivery hose, made here in the UK. It eliminates the need to add additional weights to an air hose in order to keep it on the bottom of the tank, pond or lake. Made from a reinforced PVC compound, it is very strong whilst remaining flexible.\nLIMPET comes in four sizes to suit most applications - from the smallest garden pond to the largest aquaculture or wastewater facility. (Sizes below indicate the internal diameter).\nTraditionally when installing diffused aeration systems, the task of how to deliver the air from the land-based air blower out to the lake bed diffusers has posed a problem. Until now it usually involved the use of standard braided air hose, which needed additional weights to pin it down to the bed of the pond or lake. This is a time consuming process and not ideal when the hose has to be as unobtrusive as possible, such as in a Koi pond or on a fishery. Now the task can be completed quickly and easily, leaving a neat and tidy installation.\nAs well as supplying the LIMPET hose, we can also supply a wide range of industry recognised blowers, manifolds and diffusers to complete the system.", "url": "http://www.aquacultureequipment.co.uk/index.php/products?page=shop.browse&amp;category_id=52"}

I'm trying to do this in SQL (using PostgreSQL) and I have a proposed structure for recording user changes like the following.</p>\n\n<pre><code>CREATE TABLE users (\n  userid SERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, \n  name VARCHAR(40), \n  status CHAR NOT NULL\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE status_log (\n  logid SERIAL, \n  userid INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(userid), \n  status CHAR NOT NULL, \n  logcreated TIMESTAMP\n);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That's my proposed table structure, based on the data.</p>\n\n<p>For the status field 'a' represents an active user and 's' represents a suspended user,</p>\n\n<pre><code>INSERT INTO status_log (userid, status, logcreated) VALUES (1, 's', '2008-01-01'); \nINSERT INTO status_log (userid, status, logcreated) VALUES (1, 'a', '2008-02-01'); \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So this user was suspended on 1st Jan and active again on 1st of February.</p>\n\n<p>If I wanted to get a suspended list of customers on 15th January 2008, then userid 1 should show up. If I get a suspended list of customers on 15th February 2008, then userid 1 should not show up.</p>\n\n<p>1) Is this the best way to structure this data for this kind of query?</p>\n\n<p>2) How do I query the data in either this structure or in your proposed modified structure so that I can simply have a date (say 15th January) and find a list of customers that had an active status on that date in SQL only? Is this a job for SQL?</p>\n\n<p>This can be done, but would be a lot more efficient if you stored the end date of each log.  With your model you have to do something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>select l1.userid\nfrom status_log l1\nwhere l1.status='s'\nand l1.logcreated = (select max(l2.logcreated)\n                     from status_log l2\n                     where l2.userid = l1.userid\n                     and   l2.logcreated &lt;= date '2008-02-15'\n                    );\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With the additional column it woud be more like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>select userid\nfrom status_log\nwhere status='s'\nand logcreated &lt;= date '2008-02-15'\nand logsuperseded &gt;= date '2008-02-15';\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(Apologies for any syntax errors, I don't know Postgresql.)</p>\n\n<p>To address some further issues raised by Phil:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A user might get moved from active, to suspended, to cancelled, to active again. This is a simplified version, in reality, there are even more states and people can be moved directly from one state to another.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This would appear in the table like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>userid  from       to         status\nFRED    2008-01-01 2008-01-31 s\nFRED    2008-02-01 2008-02-07 c\nFRED    2008-02-08            a\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I used a null for the \"to\" date of the current record.  I could have used a future date like 2999-12-31 but null is preferable in some ways.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Additionally, there would be no \"end date\" for the current status either, so I think this slightly breaks your query?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, my query would have to be re-written as</p>\n\n<pre><code>select userid\nfrom status_log\nwhere status='s'\nand logcreated &lt;= date '2008-02-15'\nand (logsuperseded is null or logsuperseded &gt;= date '2008-02-15');\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>A downside of this design is that whenever the user's status changes you have to end date their current status_log as well as create a new one.  However, that isn't difficult, and I think the query advantage probably outweighs this.</p>\n", "url": null}

Sloane Stephens is winning this tournament,\" McEnroe tweeted after Stephens dispatched qualifier Magdalena Frech 6-2, 6-2 in just over an hour on Wednesday.\nThe 10th-seeded American player, who never got past the fourth round in her six previous appearances at the tournament, is more cautious. She missed the tournament last year and went through a stretch of poor results after winning at Flushing Meadows. She knows getting carried away would be a big mistake.\n\"That's so sweet, that was nice of him,\" Stephens said about McEnroe's tweet. \"I mean, I can't predict the future, I don't know. I would love to. We'll see next Saturday.\"\nThere is a very long way to go for Stephens, who has yet to meet top contenders in Paris. She will face a more serious test in the third round against Camila Giorgi of Italy, who has lost only eight games in the first two matches.\nGiorgi has beaten Stephens twice in their three meetings, including a 6-3, 6-0 rout in Sidney this year on hard court. Stephens does not give too much importance to that result, though, as it came during her post-U.S. Open struggles following a knee injury.\n\"I was coming out of an injury and tried to get my season started,\" she said.\nAfter winning in New York, Stephens did not win a match for the rest of the season. She was beaten in the first round at the Australian Open in January and struggled with her tennis until March when she won the title in Miami.\nSo for now in Paris, Stephens is just happy to \"feel good.\"", "url": "https://www.parrysound.com/sports-story/8640656-us-open-champion-stephens-in-good-form-at-french-open/"}

Mueller III, the special counsel investigating ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.\nThen there were the clauses that were too obscure even for Professor Wexler.\n“I don’t think anyone even knew how to pronounce the word ‘emoluments,’ much less know what it might mean, before Trump took office,” Professor Wexler said. Now there are several lawsuits challenging payments to Mr. Trump’s companies as violations of the Constitution’s two emoluments clauses, which bar federal officials from accepting compensation from foreign governments or payments from the federal government or the states beyond their salaries.\nSanford V. Levinson, a law professor at the University of Texas, said Mr. Trump’s presidency had revealed some shortcomings of the Constitution. For instance, he said, the framers should have made it easier to remove the president before his term was over.\n“The fixed four-year term means we’re stuck with him unless we go through an unlikely impeachment or the 25th Amendment,” he said, referring to an elaborate and confusing method of removing a president “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.”\n“A desirable system,” Professor Levinson said, “would offer a way of voting ‘no confidence.’”\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Big deal. They guaranteed freedom of speech, of the press, of street demonstrations and protests, and anyone who is caught trying to suppress criticism of the government will be called to account. Whoa, that is wonderful stuff!”\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n“Of course,” Justice Scalia continued, “it’s just words on paper, what our framers would have called a ‘parchment guarantee.’”\nLegal scholars around the nation said the nation might soon decide whether its sacred founding charter was built to last.\nThat is “what’s different about teaching con law in the Trump era,” said Leah Litman, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine. It requires, she said, “acknowledging that much of what we consider settled beyond the capacity of lawyers to unsettle it may not be so settled after all.”\nDavid Strauss, a law professor at the University of Chicago, said he had been trying recently to convey that unsettled state of constitutional law to his students.\n“A lot of what we teach in constitutional law classes rests on unspoken assumptions about how people in the government will behave,” Professor Strauss said. “Everyone understands that when we’re talking about other countries — their constitutions may look great, but if the officials are authoritarian or corrupt, the formal law won’t matter very much.”\n“Now we have to think about those questions,” he said, “in explaining to students how our own constitutional principles are vulnerable and what we can do about it.”\nThe sudden relevance of constitutional law is harrowing and heartening to people who have spent their careers studying and teaching it, said Vikram D. Amar, dean of the University of Illinois College of Law.\n“Many constitutionalists I know seem somewhat anxious these days,” he said. But, he added, “recent events make our life’s work more salient and urgent.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/14/us/politics/trump-constitution-law-schools.html?partner=rss&emc=rss"}

The prime example of this behavior is the Shoutcast DSP plugin (could be useful for solution testing).</p>\n\n<p>How Can I re-enable XP-mixer controls, or maybe emulate this behavior somehow, so that the program (SC DSP) can properly manage Microphone/Line-In playback volume along with Wave-out playback volume?</p>\n\n<p>My thinking would be to emulate a program hooked-in into the Vista Mixer for Wave-Out and Line-out (or Mic speaker volume -- all playback, shown as separate adjustable \"programs\" so that the Vista Mixer could refer to it) and 'hook' it into the system under some emulation representing itself as the old volume mixer control interface for the program, but I frankly have no idea how to do that.</p>\n\n<p>To clarify: this is not my PC (it is a HP Pavilion laptop). The problem seems to exist mostly due to the fact that Vista mixer controls separate programs, not separate inputs/outputs. The hardware is fully capable of doing what is needed when using Windows XP. I am well aware of the fact that this is a driver issue, but the driver is simply prepared for what Vista presents to the programmer through interfaces. The mixer device - as seen in the operating system, however it might look in software - is based on the mixer APIs for Windows Audio control.</p>\n\n<p>Search using Google on Vista and line-in playback volume control for more info on the problem (and the sheer amount of users affected by it). Of course, a re-write of the Shoutcast Source DSP plug-in for WinAMP would do the trick, but that is not likely to happen...</p>\n\n<p>Controlling the volume levels of a soundcards indivudual input/output levels in Windows Vista mixer is possible using the audio <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms679162(VS.85).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">EndPoint API</a></p>\n\n<p>This should allow you to adjust the main volume, and the volume of and <strong>connected</strong> audio inputs.

{"text": "The mini car segment has always been stable, especially in Europe, accounting for 8% of sales for the entire market. However, the situation is changing, as automakers find it increasingly difficult to profit from their sales due to stricter environmental standards and higher technology demand.\nThe German Volkswagen Group and the French PSA Group expressed uncertainty about their future in the mini-car segment. VW Group CEO Herbert Diss complained about even more stringent environmental regulations, which will be introduced in 2020 – he fears that minicars will not be able to meet new standards, while maintaining a competitive value.\nFor example, now the European price tag on the most compact model VW Up! starts from 11 thousand euros, but due to the introduction of new standards, the model can rise in price by 3,500 thousand euros. The company is not sure how many customers can afford (and want) to buy entry-level models.\nAs for the PSA Group, the production of their Peugeot 108 and Citroen C1 minicars may cease after Toyota bought their joint plant in the Czech Republic in 2021. In this case, the French may simply leave the segment, since it may be impossible to postpone production and is simply unprofitable.\nIt is believed that increasingly stringent environmental regulations and more and more expensive modern technology in cars will ultimately negate the life of the mini-car segment. It is possible that the development of electrification will be able to save it, but this is not about the short term, since electric vehicle technologies are still quite expensive.", "url": "http://autotimesnews.com/news/vw-and-psa-may-refuse-to-release-compact-cars/"}

{"text": "Dos años de una política exterior conservadora | Revista Ideele\nDos años de una política exterior conservadora\nLuego de las actividades protocolares de la toma de mando, el Presidente renovó su compromiso por la Gran Transformación (Foto: La Mula)\nLa participación del presidente Ollanta Humala en la Cumbre de Unasur realizada en la ciudad de Asunción a fines de octubre del 2011, a pocos meses de iniciado su gobierno, reactivó las alarmas en algunos sectores del país respecto al posible alineamiento del Perú a nivel internacional con el llamado “eje chavista”. El discurso pronunciado por el Presidente peruano, quien enfatizó el papel del Estado y señaló críticas al sector privado, recibió un fuerte rechazo de aquéllos que todavía consideraban, en ese momento, que la transformación del candidato Ollanta Humala solo se dio para fines electorales. Más allá del temor existente, hoy, dos años después, en materia de política exterior el Perú ha mostrado poco o nada.\nPor el contrario, si bien hace unos meses el Presidente peruano asistió al funeral del exmandatario venezolano Hugo Chávez (al igual que la mayor parte de los presidentes de la región), en la actualidad sus preferencias por la Alianza del Pacífico en desmedro de otros mecanismos de integración regional y su ausencia a la cita en Cochabamba luego del agravio que sufrió recientemente el presidente boliviano Evo Morales por parte de un grupo de países europeos, demostrarían la orientación conservadora de nuestra política exterior, a diferencia de lo señalado en el Plan de Gobierno del Partido Nacionalista (“La Gran Transformación 2011-2016”), que ponía énfasis en algunos aspectos que han sido dejados de lado.\nUn tema recurrente en este Plan es el referido a la integración regional. El fortalecimiento de la Comunidad Andina y la Unasur eran ejes centrales que hoy tienen menos importancia que la Alianza del Pacifico, un mecanismo sobre todo de índole económica creado a finales del gobierno anterior. En tal sentido, la presidencia pro tempore de Unasur parece haber resultado incómoda en más de un momento, frente a la ruptura democrática en Paraguay, las elecciones en Venezuela y lo sucedido con el presidente boliviano en Europa.\nEs de señalar que las disposiciones adoptadas a nivel interno en materia de política económica tienen indefectiblemente un reflejo a nivel externo, de forma tal que el discurso del presidente Humala en favor de la inclusión social y la promoción del comercio y la inversión es reiterado en todas las actividades que lleva a cabo en el extranjero. No debe extrañar que la crítica al “dogma neoliberal” y a la globalización económica, presente en su Plan de Gobierno, haya sido olvidada.\nEsta lectura económico-comercial que se ha venido utilizando en el Perú en los últimos dos décadas se ha consolidado en el actual Gobierno. Algunos podrán decir que es una muestra de pragmatismo frente a la crisis económica internacional; otros señalarán que es muestra de una política exterior ideologizada que continúa al frente más allá del gobierno que sea elegido. Lo cierto es que pensar en “desarrollar una nueva relación internacional, comercial y económica”, de acuerdo con lo dispuesto en el Plan de Gobierno, hoy parece imposible. Nuestra diplomacia no solo ha priorizado la relación con nuestros principales socios comerciales —la UE, los Estados Unidos y China, en desmedro del Brasil—, incluyendo visitas oficiales al más alto nivel, sino también el papel cada vez más importante del Mincetur en materia de política exterior.\nNo debe extrañar que la crítica al “dogma neoliberal” y a la globalización económica, presente en su Plan de Gobierno, haya sido olvidada.\nLa mirada crítica del orden internacional del Plan de Gobierno nacionalista también incluía la reforma del sistema financiero internacional y de la Organización de los Estados Americanos, pero se ha avanzado muy poco al respecto. Más bien, resulta extraño que la participación del Perú en el debate acerca de la lucha contra las drogas a nivel interamericano, planteándose la posibilidad de su legalización, haya sido muy reducida, más aún teniendo en cuenta que somos el primer productor de cocaína del mundo.\nCon los elogios al modelo brasileño y la intención del Presidente, explícita o implícita, de parecerse a Lula da Silva, se hubiera pensado en tener la capacidad de dialogar con países disímiles, pero el Perú no es Brasil ni Ollanta Humala es Lula. Las presiones internas y las alianzas (y rupturas) forjadas por el Gobierno del Perú hacen imposible mantener una política en este sentido. La mejor muestra de ello ha sido la fuerte crítica que se ha llevado a cabo al papel del Perú frente a las elecciones venezolanas. Ciertamente, existe toda una institucionalidad en materia de defensa de la democracia que debe promoverse y profundizarse a nivel regional, pero nuestros intereses como país, los compromisos internacionales asumidos, el principio de no injerencia en los asuntos internos, y el hecho de que paralelamente tratamos de consolidar relaciones con países claramente autoritarios, como es el caso de aquéllos que conforman el Consejo de Cooperación del Golfo (Bahréin, Kuwait, Omán, Catar, Arabia Saudita y los Emiratos Árabes Unidos), con los cuales firmamos un acuerdo comercial en la cumbre ASPA realizada en nuestra capital, denotan una lectura mucho más compleja de esta problemática.\nUn aspecto central para Torre Tagle ha sido el diferendo marítimo con Chile ante la Corte Internacional de Justicia de La Haya. Por un lado, no solo se ha visto una defensa de primer nivel, logro que el actual Gobierno debe compartir con los anteriores, pues el proceso se inició algunos años atrás, sino que es preciso reconocer también que el Gobierno de Humala ha logrado cierto nivel de tranquilidad frente a la proximidad del fallo, construyendo una agenda de cara a futuro con Chile, luego de una difícil fase oral, bajo la premisa expresada por ambas partes de respeto al fallo.\nUn tema que quizá deba ser reconsiderado a nivel bilateral es la relación con Bolivia y Ecuador. Como presidente electo, mas no en funciones, Ollanta Humala realizó una visita a Bolivia y prometió trabajar por la reunificación de ambos países; sin embargo, irónicamente, todavía se encuentra a la espera de ser ratificado por nuestro Congreso el acuerdo de Ilo firmado el 2010 y modificado el 2012. Tratándose del Ecuador, el incidente con el Embajador de ese país puede haber dañado la relación bilateral; no resulta casual la repentina ausencia del presidente Humala a la toma de mando de Rafael Correa.\nPara finalizar, es de mencionar que estos dos últimos años no han estado carentes de momentos difíciles que demuestran que todavía tenemos mucho que mejorar en materia de política burocrática. Los problemas surgidos en torno a la visita de la fragata británica y nuestro compromiso con la causa argentina sobre las islas Malvinas, la crisis generada a partir del comportamiento del Embajador ecuatoriano o las diferencias públicas entre Mincetur y Cancillería por su papel en materia económica, podrían haberse evitado.\nEl Gobierno de Ollanta Humala tiene grandes retos, pero parece carecer de cuadros que puedan tomar la batuta hacia una política exterior más progresista. Habiendo sido un admirador del presidente Velasco Alvarado, ya quisiera tener entre sus filas a un Mercado Jarrín para hacer frente a los próximos tres años.", "url": "https://revistaideele.com/ideele/content/dos-a%C3%B1os-de-una-pol%C3%ADtica-exterior-conservadora"}

He sido muy directa con él, y él es muy directo conmigo. Mantiene su inocencia y le creo\", aseguró la actriz.

{"text": "Aspirin\n\nAspirin, also known as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to reduce pain, fever, and/or inflammation, and as an antithrombotic. Specific inflammatory conditions which aspirin is used to treat include Kawasaki disease, pericarditis, and rheumatic fever.\n\nAspirin is also used long-term to help prevent further heart attacks, ischaemic strokes, and blood clots in people at high risk. For pain or fever, effects typically begin within 30 minutes. Aspirin works similarly to other NSAIDs but also suppresses the normal functioning of platelets.\n\nOne common adverse effect is an upset stomach. More significant side effects include stomach ulcers, stomach bleeding, and worsening asthma. Bleeding risk is greater among those who are older, drink alcohol, take other NSAIDs, or are on other blood thinners. Aspirin is not recommended in the last part of pregnancy. It is not generally recommended in children with infections because of the risk of Reye syndrome. High doses may result in ringing in the ears.\n\nA precursor to aspirin found in the bark of the willow tree (genus Salix) has been used for its health effects for at least 2,400 years. In 1853, chemist Charles Frédéric Gerhardt treated the medicine sodium salicylate with acetyl chloride to produce acetylsalicylic acid for the first time. Over the next 50 years, other chemists established the chemical structure and devised more efficient production methods.\n\nAspirin is available without medical prescription as a proprietary or generic medication in most jurisdictions. It is one of the most widely used medications globally, with an estimated  (50 to 120 billion pills) consumed each year, and is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2020, it was the 36th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 17million prescriptions.\n\nBrand vs. generic name\nIn 1897, scientists at the Bayer company began studying acetylsalicylic acid as a less-irritating replacement medication for common salicylate medicines. By 1899, Bayer had named it \"Aspirin\" and sold it around the world.\n\nAspirin's popularity grew over the first half of the 20th century, leading to competition between many brands and formulations. The word Aspirin was Bayer's brand name; however, their rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries. The name is ultimately a blend of the prefix a(cetyl) + spir Spiraea, the meadowsweet plant genus from which the acetylsalicylic acid was originally derived at Bayer + -in, the common chemical suffix.\n\nChemical properties\nAspirin decomposes rapidly in solutions of ammonium acetate or the acetates, carbonates, citrates, or hydroxides of the alkali metals. It is stable in dry air, but gradually hydrolyses in contact with moisture to acetic and salicylic acids. In solution with alkalis, the hydrolysis proceeds rapidly and the clear solutions formed may consist entirely of acetate and salicylate.\n\nLike flour mills, factories producing aspirin tablets must control the amount of the powder that becomes airborne inside the building, because the powder-air mixture can be explosive. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit in the United States of 5mg/m3 (time-weighted average). In 1989, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) set a legal permissible exposure limit for aspirin of 5mg/m3, but this was vacated by the AFL-CIO v. OSHA decision in 1993.\n\nSynthesis\nThe synthesis of aspirin is classified as an esterification reaction. Salicylic acid is treated with acetic anhydride, an acid derivative, causing a chemical reaction that turns salicylic acid's hydroxyl group into an ester group (R-OH → R-OCOCH3). This process yields aspirin and acetic acid, which is considered a byproduct of this reaction. Small amounts of sulfuric acid (and occasionally phosphoric acid) are almost always used as a catalyst. This method is commonly demonstrated in undergraduate teaching labs.\n\nReaction between acetic acid and salicylic acid can also form aspirin but this esterification reaction is reversible and the presence of water can lead to hydrolysis of the aspirin. So, an anhydrous reagent is preferred.\nReaction mechanism\n\nFormulations containing high concentrations of aspirin often smell like vinegar because aspirin can decompose through hydrolysis in moist conditions, yielding salicylic and acetic acids.\n\nPhysical properties\nAspirin, an acetyl derivative of salicylic acid, is a white, crystalline, weakly acidic substance, which melts at , and decomposes around . Its acid dissociation constant (pKa) is 3.5 at .\n\nPolymorphism\n\nPolymorphism, or the ability of a substance to form more than one crystal structure, is important in the development of pharmaceutical ingredients. Many drugs receive regulatory approval for only a single crystal form or polymorph.\n\nThere was only one proven polymorph Form I of aspirin, though the existence of another polymorph was debated since the 1960s, and one report from 1981 reported that when crystallized in the presence of aspirin anhydride, the diffractogram of aspirin has weak additional peaks. Though at the time it was dismissed as mere impurity, it was, in retrospect, Form II aspirin.\n\nForm II was reported in 2005, found after attempted co-crystallization of aspirin and levetiracetam from hot acetonitrile.\n\nIn form I, pairs of aspirin molecules form centrosymmetric dimers through the acetyl groups with the (acidic) methyl proton to carbonyl hydrogen bonds. In form II, each aspirin molecule forms the same hydrogen bonds, but with two neighbouring molecules instead of one. With respect to the hydrogen bonds formed by the carboxylic acid groups, both polymorphs form identical dimer structures. The aspirin polymorphs contain identical 2-dimensional sections and are therefore more precisely described as polytypes.\n\nPure Form II aspirin could be prepared by seeding the batch with aspirin anhydrate in 15% weight.\n\nMechanism of action\n\nDiscovery of the mechanism\nIn 1971, British pharmacologist John Robert Vane, then employed by the Royal College of Surgeons in London, showed aspirin suppressed the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes. For this discovery he was awarded the 1982 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, jointly with Sune Bergström and Bengt Ingemar Samuelsson.\n\nProstaglandins and thromboxanes\nAspirin's ability to suppress the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes is due to its irreversible inactivation of the cyclooxygenase (COX; officially known as prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase, PTGS) enzyme required for prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis. Aspirin acts as an acetylating agent where an acetyl group is covalently attached to a serine residue in the active site of the PTGS enzyme (Suicide inhibition). This makes aspirin different from other NSAIDs (such as diclofenac and ibuprofen), which are reversible inhibitors.\n\nLow-dose aspirin use irreversibly blocks the formation of thromboxane A2 in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation during the lifetime of the affected platelet (8–9 days). This antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks in people who have had a heart attack, unstable angina, ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. 40mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum thromboxane A2 release provoked acutely, with the prostaglandin I2 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition.\n\nProstaglandins, local hormones produced in the body, have diverse effects, including the transmission of pain information to the brain, modulation of the hypothalamic thermostat, and inflammation. Thromboxanes are responsible for the aggregation of platelets that form blood clots. Heart attacks are caused primarily by blood clots, and low doses of aspirin are seen as an effective medical intervention to prevent a second acute myocardial infarction.\n\nCOX-1 and COX-2 inhibition\nAt least two different types of cyclooxygenases, COX-1 and COX-2, are acted on by aspirin. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and modifies the enzymatic activity of COX-2. COX-2 normally produces prostanoids, most of which are proinflammatory. Aspirin-modified PTGS2 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2) produces lipoxins, most of which are anti-inflammatory. Newer NSAID drugs, COX-2 inhibitors (coxibs), have been developed to inhibit only PTGS2, with the intent to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects.\n\nSeveral COX-2 inhibitors, such as rofecoxib (Vioxx), have been withdrawn from the market, after evidence emerged that PTGS2 inhibitors increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. Endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the body are proposed to express PTGS2, and, by selectively inhibiting PTGS2, prostaglandin production (specifically, PGI2; prostacyclin) is downregulated with respect to thromboxane levels, as PTGS1 in platelets is unaffected. Thus, the protective anticoagulative effect of PGI2 is removed, increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems. Since platelets have no DNA, they are unable to synthesize new PTGS once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme, an important difference as compared with reversible inhibitors.\n\nFurthermore, aspirin, while inhibiting the ability of COX-2 to form pro-inflammatory products such as the prostaglandins, converts this enzyme's activity from a prostaglandin-forming cyclooxygenase to a lipoxygenase-like enzyme: aspirin-treated COX-2 metabolizes a variety of polyunsaturated fatty acids to hydroperoxy products which are then further metabolized to specialized proresolving mediators such as the aspirin-triggered lipoxins, aspirin-triggered resolvins, and aspirin-triggered maresins. These mediators possess potent anti-inflammatory activity. It is proposed that this aspirin-triggered transition of COX-2 from cyclooxygenase to lipoxygenase activity and the consequential formation of specialized proresolving mediators contributes to the anti-inflammatory effects of aspirin.\n\nAdditional mechanisms\nAspirin has been shown to have at least three additional modes of action. It uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in cartilaginous (and hepatic) mitochondria, by diffusing from the inner membrane space as a proton carrier back into the mitochondrial matrix, where it ionizes once again to release protons. Aspirin buffers and transports the protons. When high doses are given, it may actually cause fever, owing to the heat released from the electron transport chain, as opposed to the antipyretic action of aspirin seen with lower doses. In addition, aspirin induces the formation of NO-radicals in the body, which have been shown in mice to have an independent mechanism of reducing inflammation. This reduced leukocyte adhesion is an important step in the immune response to infection; however, evidence is insufficient to show aspirin helps to fight infection. More recent data also suggest salicylic acid and its derivatives modulate signalling through NF-κB. NF-κB, a transcription factor complex, plays a central role in many biological processes, including inflammation.\n\nAspirin is readily broken down in the body to salicylic acid, which itself has anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic effects. In 2012, salicylic acid was found to activate AMP-activated protein kinase, which has been suggested as a possible explanation for some of the effects of both salicylic acid and aspirin. The acetyl portion of the aspirin molecule has its own targets. Acetylation of cellular proteins is a well-established phenomenon in the regulation of protein function at the post-translational level. Aspirin is able to acetylate several other targets in addition to COX isoenzymes. These acetylation reactions may explain many hitherto unexplained effects of aspirin.\n\nFormulations\n\nAspirin is produced in many formulations, with some differences in effect. In particular, aspirin can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, and formulations are sought which deliver the benefits of aspirin while mitigating harmful bleeding. Formulations may be combined (e.g., buffered + vitamin C).\nTablets, typically of about 75–100 mg and 300–320 mg of immediate-release aspirin (IR-ASA).\nDispersible tablets.\nEnteric-coated tablets.\nBuffered formulations containing aspirin with one of many buffering agents.\nFormulations of aspirin with vitamin C (ASA-VitC)\nA phospholipid-aspirin complex liquid formulation, PL-ASA.  the phospholipid coating was being trialled to determine if it caused less gastrointestinal damage.\n\nPharmacokinetics\nAcetylsalicylic acid is a weak acid, and very little of it is ionized in the stomach after oral administration. Acetylsalicylic acid is quickly absorbed through the cell membrane in the acidic conditions of the stomach. The increased pH and larger surface area of the small intestine causes aspirin to be absorbed more slowly there, as more of it is ionized. Owing to the formation of concretions, aspirin is absorbed much more slowly during overdose, and plasma concentrations can continue to rise for up to 24 hours after ingestion.\n\nAbout 50–80% of salicylate in the blood is bound to human serum albumin, while the rest remains in the active, ionized state; protein binding is concentration-dependent. Saturation of binding sites leads to more free salicylate and increased toxicity. The volume of distribution is 0.1–0.2 L/kg. Acidosis increases the volume of distribution because of enhancement of tissue penetration of salicylates.\n\nAs much as 80% of therapeutic doses of salicylic acid is metabolized in the liver. Conjugation with glycine forms salicyluric acid, and with glucuronic acid to form two different glucuronide esters. The conjugate with the acetyl group intact is referred to as the acyl glucuronide; the deacetylated conjugate is the phenolic glucuronide. These metabolic pathways have only a limited capacity. Small amounts of salicylic acid are also hydroxylated to gentisic acid. With large salicylate doses, the kinetics switch from first-order to zero-order, as metabolic pathways become saturated and renal excretion becomes increasingly important.\n\nSalicylates are excreted mainly by the kidneys as salicyluric acid (75%), free salicylic acid (10%), salicylic phenol (10%), and acyl glucuronides (5%), gentisic acid (< 1%), and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid. When small doses (less than 250mg in an adult) are ingested, all pathways proceed by first-order kinetics, with an elimination half-life of about 2.0 h to 4.5 h. When higher doses of salicylate are ingested (more than 4 g), the half-life becomes much longer (15 h to 30 h), because the biotransformation pathways concerned with the formation of salicyluric acid and salicyl phenolic glucuronide become saturated. Renal excretion of salicylic acid becomes increasingly important as the metabolic pathways become saturated, because it is extremely sensitive to changes in urinary pH. A 10- to 20-fold increase in renal clearance occurs when urine pH is increased from 5 to 8. The use of urinary alkalinization exploits this particular aspect of salicylate elimination. It was found that short-term aspirin use in therapeutic doses might precipitate reversible acute kidney injury when the patient was ill with glomerulonephritis or cirrhosis. Aspirin for some patients with chronic kidney disease and some children with congestive heart failure was contraindicated.\n\nHistory\n\nMedicines made from willow and other salicylate-rich plants appear in clay tablets from ancient Sumer as well as the Ebers Papyrus from ancient Egypt. Hippocrates referred to the use of salicylic tea to reduce fevers around 400 BC, and willow bark preparations were part of the pharmacopoeia of Western medicine in classical antiquity and the Middle Ages. Willow bark extract became recognized for its specific effects on fever, pain, and inflammation in the mid-eighteenth century. By the nineteenth century, pharmacists were experimenting with and prescribing a variety of chemicals related to salicylic acid, the active component of willow extract.\n\nIn 1853, chemist Charles Frédéric Gerhardt treated sodium salicylate with acetyl chloride to produce acetylsalicylic acid for the first time; in the second half of the 19th century, other academic chemists established the compound's chemical structure and devised more efficient methods of synthesis. In 1897, scientists at the drug and dye firm Bayer began investigating acetylsalicylic acid as a less-irritating replacement for standard common salicylate medicines, and identified a new way to synthesize it. By 1899, Bayer had dubbed this drug Aspirin and was selling it globally. The word Aspirin was Bayer's brand name, rather than the generic name of the drug; however, Bayer's rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries. Aspirin's popularity grew over the first half of the 20th century leading to fierce competition with the proliferation of aspirin brands and products.\n\nAspirin's popularity declined after the development of acetaminophen/paracetamol in 1956 and ibuprofen in 1962. In the 1960s and 1970s, John Vane and others discovered the basic mechanism of aspirin's effects, while clinical trials and other studies from the 1960s to the 1980s established aspirin's efficacy as an anti-clotting agent that reduces the risk of clotting diseases. The initial large studies on the use of low-dose aspirin to prevent heart attacks that were published in the 1970s and 1980s helped spur reform in clinical research ethics and guidelines for human subject research and US federal law, and are often cited as examples of clinical trials that included only men, but from which people drew general conclusions that did not hold true for women.\n\nAspirin sales revived considerably in the last decades of the 20th century, and remain strong in the 21st century with widespread use as a preventive treatment for heart attacks and strokes.\n\nTrademark \n\nBayer lost its trademark for Aspirin in the United States and some other countries in actions taken between 1918 and 1921 because it had failed to use the name for its own product correctly and had for years allowed the use of \"Aspirin\" by other manufacturers without defending the intellectual property rights. Today, aspirin is a generic trademark in many countries. Aspirin, with a capital \"A\", remains a registered trademark of Bayer in Germany, Canada, Mexico, and in over 80 other countries, for acetylsalicylic acid in all markets, but using different packaging and physical aspects for each.\n\nCompendial status\n United States Pharmacopeia\n British Pharmacopoeia\n\nMedical use\nAspirin is used in the treatment of a number of conditions, including fever, pain, rheumatic fever, and inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, pericarditis, and Kawasaki disease. Lower doses of aspirin have also been shown to reduce the risk of death from a heart attack, or the risk of stroke in people who are at high risk or who have cardiovascular disease, but not in elderly people who are otherwise healthy. There is evidence that aspirin is effective at preventing colorectal cancer, though the mechanisms of this effect are unclear. In the United States, the selective initiation of low-dose aspirin, based on an individualised assessment, has been deemed reasonable for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in people aged between 40 and 59 who have a 10% or greater risk of developing cardiovascular disease over the next 10 years and are not at an increased risk of bleeding.\n\nPain\n\nAspirin is an effective analgesic for acute pain, although it is generally considered inferior to ibuprofen because aspirin is more likely to cause gastrointestinal bleeding. Aspirin is generally ineffective for those pains caused by muscle cramps, bloating, gastric distension, or acute skin irritation. As with other NSAIDs, combinations of aspirin and caffeine provide slightly greater pain relief than aspirin alone. Effervescent formulations of aspirin relieve pain faster than aspirin in tablets, which makes them useful for the treatment of migraines. Topical aspirin may be effective for treating some types of neuropathic pain.\n\nAspirin, either by itself or in a combined formulation, effectively treats certain types of a headache, but its efficacy may be questionable for others. Secondary headaches, meaning those caused by another disorder or trauma, should be promptly treated by a medical provider. Among primary headaches, the International Classification of Headache Disorders distinguishes between tension headache (the most common), migraine, and cluster headache. Aspirin or other over-the-counter analgesics are widely recognized as effective for the treatment of tension headaches. Aspirin, especially as a component of an aspirin/paracetamol/caffeine combination, is considered a first-line therapy in the treatment of migraine, and comparable to lower doses of sumatriptan. It is most effective at stopping migraines when they are first beginning.\n\nFever\nLike its ability to control pain, aspirin's ability to control fever is due to its action on the prostaglandin system through its irreversible inhibition of COX. Although aspirin's use as an antipyretic in adults is well established, many medical societies and regulatory agencies, including the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the Food and Drug Administration, strongly advise against using aspirin for the treatment of fever in children because of the risk of Reye's syndrome, a rare but often fatal illness associated with the use of aspirin or other salicylates in children during episodes of viral or bacterial infection. Because of the risk of Reye's syndrome in children, in 1986, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required labeling on all aspirin-containing medications advising against its use in children and teenagers.\n\nInflammation\nAspirin is used as an anti-inflammatory agent for both acute and long-term inflammation, as well as for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nHeart attacks and strokes\nAspirin is an important part of the treatment of those who have had a heart attack. It is generally not recommended for routine use by people with no other health problems, including those over the age of 70.\n\nThe 2009 Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration published in Lancet evaluated the efficacy and safety of low dose aspirin in secondary prevention. In those with prior ischaemic stroke or acute myocardial infarction, daily low dose aspirin was associated with a 19% relative risk reduction of serious cardiovascular events (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or vascular death). This did come at the expense of a 0.19% absolute risk increase in gastrointestinal bleeding; however, the benefits outweigh the hazard risk in this case. Data from previous trials have suggested that weight-based dosing of aspirin has greater benefits in primary prevention of cardiovascular outcomes. However, more recent trials were not able to replicate similar outcomes using low dose aspirin in low body weight (<70 kg) in specific subset of population studied i.e. elderly and diabetic population, and more evidence is required to study the effect of high dose aspirin in high body weight (≥70 kg).\n\nAfter percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs), such as the placement of a coronary artery stent, a U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guideline recommends that aspirin be taken indefinitely. Frequently, aspirin is combined with an ADP receptor inhibitor, such as clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor to prevent blood clots. This is called dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). Duration of DAPT was advised in the United States and European Union guidelines after the CURE  and PRODIGY  studies . In 2020, the systematic review and network meta-analysis from Khan et al. showed promising benefits of short-term (< 6 months) DAPT followed by P2Y12 inhibitors in selected patients, as well as the benefits of extended-term (> 12 months) DAPT in high risk patients. In conclusion, the optimal duration of DAPT after PCIs should be personalized after outweighing each patient's risks of ischemic events and risks of bleeding events with consideration of multiple patient-related and procedure-related factors. Moreover, aspirin should be continued indefinitely after DAPT is complete.\n\nThe status of the use of aspirin for the primary prevention in cardiovascular disease is conflicting and inconsistent, with recent changes from previously recommending it widely decades ago, and that some referenced newer trials in clinical guidelines show less of benefit of adding aspirin alongside other anti-hypertensive and cholesterol lowering therapies. The ASCEND study demonstrated that in high-bleeding risk diabetics with no prior cardiovascular disease, there is no overall clinical benefit (12% decrease in risk of ischaemic events v/s 29% increase in GI bleeding) of low dose aspirin in preventing the serious vascular events over a period of 7.4 years. Similarly, the results of the ARRIVE study also showed no benefit of same dose of aspirin in reducing the time to first cardiovascular outcome in patients with moderate risk of cardiovascular disease over a period of five years. Aspirin has also been suggested as a component of a polypill for prevention of cardiovascular disease. Complicating the use of aspirin for prevention is the phenomenon of aspirin resistance. For people who are resistant, aspirin's efficacy is reduced. Some authors have suggested testing regimens to identify people who are resistant to aspirin.\n\nAs of , the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) determined that there was a \"small net benefit\" for patients aged 40–59 with a 10% or greater 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, and \"no net benefit\" for patients aged over 60. Determining the net benefit was based on balancing the risk reduction of taking aspirin for heart attacks and ischaemic strokes, with the increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and hemorrhagic strokes. Their recommendations state that age changes the risk of the medicine, with the magnitude of the benefit of aspirin coming from starting at a younger age, while the risk of bleeding, while small, increases with age, particular for adults over 60, and can be compounded by other risk factors such as diabetes and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. As a result, the USPSTF suggests that \"people ages 40 to 59 who are at higher risk for CVD should decide with their clinician whether to start taking aspirin; people 60 or older should not start taking aspirin to prevent a first heart attack or stroke.\" Primary prevention guidelines from  made by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association state they might consider aspirin for patients aged 40–69 with a higher risk of atherosclerotic CVD, without an increased bleeding risk, while stating they would not recommend aspirin for patients aged over 70 or adults of any age with an increased bleeding risk. They state a CVD risk estimation and a risk discussion should be done before starting on aspirin, while stating aspirin should be used \"infrequently in the routine primary prevention of (atherosclerotic CVD) because of lack of net benefit\". As of , the European Society of Cardiology made similar recommendations; considering aspirin specifically to patients aged less than 70 at high or very high CVD risk, without any clear contraindications, on a case-by-case basis considering both ischemic risk and bleeding risk.\n\nCancer prevention\nAspirin may reduce the overall risk of both getting cancer and dying from cancer. There is substantial evidence for lowering the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), but aspirin must be taken for at least 10–20 years to see this benefit. It may also slightly reduce the risk of endometrial cancer and prostate cancer.\n\nSome conclude the benefits are greater than the risks due to bleeding in those at average risk. Others are unclear if the benefits are greater than the risk. Given this uncertainty, the 2007 United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines on this topic recommended against the use of aspirin for prevention of CRC in people with average risk. Nine years later however, the USPSTF issued a grade B recommendation for the use of low-dose aspirin (75 to 100mg/day) \"for the primary prevention of CVD [cardiovascular disease] and CRC in adults 50 to 59 years of age who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk, are not at increased risk for bleeding, have a life expectancy of at least 10 years, and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily for at least 10 years\".\n\nA meta-analysis through 2019 said that there was an association between taking aspirin and lower risk of cancer of the colorectum, esophagus, and stomach.\n\nIn 2021, the U.S. Preventive services Task Force raised questions about the use of aspirin in cancer prevention. It notes the results of the 2018 ASPREE (Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly) Trial, in which the risk of cancer-related death was higher in the aspirin-treated group than in the placebo group.\n\nPsychiatry\n\nBipolar disorder\nAspirin, along with several other agents with anti-inflammatory properties, has been repurposed as an add-on treatment for depressive episodes in subjects with bipolar disorder in light of the possible role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of severe mental disorders. A 2022 systematic review concluded that aspirin exposure reduced the risk of depression in a pooled cohort of three studies (HR 0.624, 95% CI: 0.0503, 1.198, P=0.033). However, further high-quality, longer-duration, double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to determine whether aspirin is an effective add-on treatment for bipolar depression. Thus, notwithstanding the biological rationale, the clinical perspectives of aspirin and anti-inflammatory agents in the treatment of bipolar depression remain uncertain.\n\nDementia\nAlthough cohort and longitudinal studies have shown low-dose aspirin has a greater likelihood of reducing the incidence of dementia, numerous randomized controlled trials have not validated this.\n\nSchizophrenia \nSome researchers have speculated the anti-inflammatory effects of aspirin may be beneficial for schizophrenia. Small trials have been conducted but evidence remains lacking.\n\nOther uses\nAspirin is a first-line treatment for the fever and joint-pain symptoms of acute rheumatic fever. The therapy often lasts for one to two weeks, and is rarely indicated for longer periods. After fever and pain have subsided, the aspirin is no longer necessary, since it does not decrease the incidence of heart complications and residual rheumatic heart disease. Naproxen has been shown to be as effective as aspirin and less toxic, but due to the limited clinical experience, naproxen is recommended only as a second-line treatment.\n\nAlong with rheumatic fever, Kawasaki disease remains one of the few indications for aspirin use in children in spite of a lack of high quality evidence for its effectiveness.\n\nLow-dose aspirin supplementation has moderate benefits when used for prevention of pre-eclampsia. This benefit is greater when started in early pregnancy.\n\nAspirin has also demonstrated anti-tumoral effects, via inhibition of the PTTG1 gene, which is often overexpressed in tumors.\n\nResistance\n\nFor some people, aspirin does not have as strong an effect on platelets as for others, an effect known as aspirin-resistance or insensitivity. One study has suggested women are more likely to be resistant than men, and a different, aggregate study of 2,930 people found 28% were resistant.\nA study in 100 Italian people found, of the apparent 31% aspirin-resistant subjects, only 5% were truly resistant, and the others were noncompliant.\nAnother study of 400 healthy volunteers found no subjects who were truly resistant, but some had \"pseudoresistance, reflecting delayed and reduced drug absorption\".\n\nMeta-analysis and systematic reviews have concluded that laboratory confirmed aspirin resistance confers increased rates of poorer outcomes in cardiovascular and neurovascular diseases. Although the majority of research conducted has surrounded cardiovascular and neurovascular, there is emerging research into the risk of aspirin resistance after orthopaedic surgery where aspirin is used for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. Aspirin resistance in orthopaedic surgery, specifically after total hip and knee arthroplasties, is of interest as risk factors for aspirin resistance are also risk factors for venous thromboembolisms and osteoarthritis; the sequalae of requiring a total hip or knee arthroplasty. Some of these risk factors include obesity, advancing age, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia and inflammatory diseases.\n\nDosages \n\nAdult aspirin tablets are produced in standardised sizes, which vary slightly from country to country, for example 300mg in Britain and 325mg in the United States. Smaller doses are based on these standards, e.g., 75mg and 81mg tablets. The 81 mg tablets are commonly called \"baby aspirin\" or \"baby-strength\", because they were originallybut no longerintended to be administered to infants and children. No medical significance occurs due to the slight difference in dosage between the 75mg and the 81mg tablets. The dose required for benefit appears to depend on a person's weight. For those weighing less than , low dose is effective for preventing cardiovascular disease; for patients above this weight, higher doses are required.\n\nIn general, for adults, doses are taken four times a day for fever or arthritis, with doses near the maximal daily dose used historically for the treatment of rheumatic fever. For the prevention of myocardial infarction (MI) in someone with documented or suspected coronary artery disease, much lower doses are taken once daily.\n\nMarch 2009 recommendations from the USPSTF on the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease encourage men aged 45–79 and women aged 55–79 to use aspirin when the potential benefit of a reduction in MI for men or stroke for women outweighs the potential harm of an increase in gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The WHI study of postmenopausal women found that aspirin resulted in a 25% lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease and a 14% lower risk of death from any cause, though there was no significant difference between 81mg and 325mg aspirin doses. The 2021 ADAPTABLE study also showed no significant difference in cardiovascular events or major bleeding between 81mg and 325mg doses of aspirin in patients (both men and women) with established cardiovascular disease.\n\nLow-dose aspirin use was also associated with a trend toward lower risk of cardiovascular events, and lower aspirin doses (75 or 81mg/day) may optimize efficacy and safety for people requiring aspirin for long-term prevention.\n\nIn children with Kawasaki disease, aspirin is taken at dosages based on body weight, initially four times a day for up to two weeks and then at a lower dose once daily for a further six to eight weeks.\n\nAdverse effects\nIn October 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the drug label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid. They recommend avoiding NSAIDs in pregnant women at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy. One exception to the recommendation is the use of low-dose 81mg aspirin at any point in pregnancy under the direction of a health care professional.\n\nContraindications\n\nAspirin should not be taken by people who are allergic to ibuprofen or naproxen, or who have salicylate intolerance or a more generalized drug intolerance to NSAIDs, and caution should be exercised in those with asthma or NSAID-precipitated bronchospasm. Owing to its effect on the stomach lining, manufacturers recommend people with peptic ulcers, mild diabetes, or gastritis seek medical advice before using aspirin. Even if none of these conditions is present, the risk of stomach bleeding is still increased when aspirin is taken with alcohol or warfarin. People with hemophilia or other bleeding tendencies should not take aspirin or other salicylates. Aspirin is known to cause hemolytic anemia in people who have the genetic disease glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, particularly in large doses and depending on the severity of the disease. Use of aspirin during dengue fever is not recommended owing to increased bleeding tendency. Aspirin taken at doses of ≤325 mg and ≤100 mg per day for ≥2 days can increase the odds of suffering a gout attack by 81% and 91% respectively. This effect may potentially be worsened by high purine diets, diuretics, and kidney disease, but is eliminated by the urate lowering drug allopurinol. Daily low dose aspirin does not appear to worsen kidney function. Aspirin may reduce cardiovascular risk in those without established cardiovascular disease in people with moderate CKD, without significantly increasing the risk of bleeding. Aspirin should not be given to children or adolescents under the age of 16 to control cold or influenza symptoms, as this has been linked with Reye's syndrome.\n\nGastrointestinal\n\nAspirin use has been shown to increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Although some enteric-coated formulations of aspirin are advertised as being \"gentle to the stomach\", in one study, enteric coating did not seem to reduce this risk; the Mayo Clinic agree with this, and report that coated aspirin may also not be as effective at reducing blood clot risk. Although enteric coated aspirin is said to be not as effective as plain aspirin in reducing blood clot risk, however, with the current available results from clinical studies, there is still insufficient data to support this statement. Larger studies are required to provide more accurate results and conclusions.\n\nCombining aspirin with other NSAIDs has been shown to further increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Using aspirin in combination with clopidogrel or warfarin also increases the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.\n\nBlockade of COX-1 by aspirin apparently results in the upregulation of COX-2 as part of a gastric defense. Several trials suggest that the simultaneous use of a COX-2 inhibitor with aspirin may increase the risk of gastrointestinal injury. However, currently available evidence has been unable to prove that this effect is consistently repeatable in everyday clinical practice. More dedicated research is required to provide greater clarity on the subject. Therefore, caution should be exercised if combining aspirin with any \"natural\" supplements with COX-2-inhibiting properties, such as garlic extracts, curcumin, bilberry, pine bark, ginkgo, fish oil, resveratrol, genistein, quercetin, resorcinol, and others.\n\n\"Buffering\" is an additional method that is used with the intention of  mitigating  gastrointestinal bleeding. Buffering agents are intended to work by preventing the aspirin from concentrating in the walls of the stomach, although the benefits of buffered aspirin are disputed. Almost any buffering agent used in antacids can be used; Bufferin, for example, uses magnesium oxide. Other preparations use calcium carbonate. Gas-forming agents in effervescent tablet and powder formulations can also double as a buffering agent, one example being sodium bicarbonate, used in Alka-Seltzer.\n\nTaking  vitamin C with aspirin has been investigated as a method of protecting the stomach lining. In trials vitamin C-releasing aspirin (ASA-VitC) or a buffered aspirin formulation containing vitamin C was found to cause less stomach damage than aspirin alone.\n\nRetinal vein occlusion\nIt is a widespread habit among eye specialists (ophthalmologists) to prescribe aspirin as an add-on medication for patients with retinal vein occlusion (RVO), such as central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) and branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO). The reason of this widespread use is the evidence of its proven effectiveness in major systemic venous thrombotic disorders, and it has been assumed that may be similarly beneficial in various types of retinal vein occlusion.\n\nHowever, a large-scale investigation based on data of nearly 700 patients showed \"that aspirin or other antiplatelet aggregating agents or anticoagulants adversely influence the visual outcome in patients with CRVO and hemi-CRVO, without any evidence of protective or beneficial effect\". Several expert groups, including the Royal College of Ophthalmologists, recommended against the use of antithrombotic drugs (incl. aspirin) for patients with RVO.\n\nCentral effects\nLarge doses of salicylate, a metabolite of aspirin, cause temporary tinnitus (ringing in the ears) based on experiments in rats, via the action on arachidonic acid and NMDA receptors cascade.\n\nReye's syndrome\n\nReye's syndrome, a rare but severe illness characterized by acute encephalopathy and fatty liver, can occur when children or adolescents are given aspirin for a fever or other illness or infection. From 1981 to 1997, 1207 cases of Reye's syndrome in people younger than 18 were reported to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Of these, 93% reported being ill in the three weeks preceding the onset of Reye's syndrome, most commonly with a respiratory infection, chickenpox, or diarrhea. Salicylates were detectable in 81.9% of children for whom test results were reported. After the association between Reye's syndrome and aspirin was reported, and safety measures to prevent it (including a Surgeon General's warning, and changes to the labeling of aspirin-containing drugs) were implemented, aspirin taken by children declined considerably in the United States, as did the number of reported cases of Reye's syndrome; a similar decline was found in the United Kingdom after warnings against pediatric aspirin use were issued. The US Food and Drug Administration recommends aspirin (or aspirin-containing products) should not be given to anyone under the age of 12 who has a fever, and the UK National Health Service recommends children who are under 16 years of age should not take aspirin, unless it is on the advice of a doctor.\n\nSkin\nFor a small number of people, taking aspirin can result in symptoms including hives, swelling, and headache. Aspirin can exacerbate symptoms among those with chronic hives, or create acute symptoms of hives. These responses can be due to allergic reactions to aspirin, or more often due to its effect of inhibiting the COX-1 enzyme. Skin reactions may also tie to systemic contraindications, seen with NSAID-precipitated bronchospasm, or those with atopy.\n\nAspirin and other NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, may delay the healing of skin wounds. Earlier findings from two small, low-quality trials suggested a benefit with aspirin (alongside compression therapy) on venous leg ulcer healing time and leg ulcer size, however larger, more recent studies of higher quality have been unable to corroborate these outcomes. As such, further research is required to clarify the role of aspirin in this context.\n\nOther adverse effects\nAspirin can induce swelling of skin tissues in some people. In one study, angioedema appeared one to six hours after ingesting aspirin in some of the people. However, when the aspirin was taken alone, it did not cause angioedema in these people; the aspirin had been taken in combination with another NSAID-induced drug when angioedema appeared.\n\nAspirin causes an increased risk of cerebral microbleeds having the appearance on MRI scans of 5 to 10mm or smaller, hypointense (dark holes) patches.\n\nA study of a group with a mean dosage of aspirin of 270mg per day estimated an average absolute risk increase in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) of 12 events per 10,000 persons. In comparison, the estimated absolute risk reduction in myocardial infarction was 137 events per 10,000 persons, and a reduction of 39 events per 10,000 persons in ischemic stroke. In cases where ICH already has occurred, aspirin use results in higher mortality, with a dose of about 250mg per day resulting in a relative risk of death within three months after the ICH around 2.5 (95% confidence interval 1.3 to 4.6).\n\nAspirin and other NSAIDs can cause abnormally high blood levels of potassium by inducing a hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronic state via inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis; however, these agents do not typically cause hyperkalemia by themselves in the setting of normal renal function and euvolemic state.\n\nUse of low-dose aspirin before a surgical procedure has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding events in some patients, however, ceasing aspirin prior to surgery has also been associated with an increase in major adverse cardiac events. An analysis of multiple studies found a three-fold increase in adverse events such as myocardial infarction in patients who ceased aspirin prior to surgery. The analysis found that the risk is dependent on the type of surgery being performed and the patient indication for aspirin use.\n\nOn 9 July 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) toughened warnings of increased heart attack and stroke risk associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). Aspirin is an NSAID but is not affected by the new warnings.\n\nOverdose\n\nAspirin overdose can be acute or chronic. In acute poisoning, a single large dose is taken; in chronic poisoning, higher than normal doses are taken over a period of time. Acute overdose has a mortality rate of 2%. Chronic overdose is more commonly lethal, with a mortality rate of 25%; chronic overdose may be especially severe in children. Toxicity is managed with a number of potential treatments, including activated charcoal, intravenous dextrose and normal saline, sodium bicarbonate, and dialysis. The diagnosis of poisoning usually involves measurement of plasma salicylate, the active metabolite of aspirin, by automated spectrophotometric methods. Plasma salicylate levels in general range from 30 to 100mg/L after usual therapeutic doses, 50–300mg/L in people taking high doses and 700–1400mg/L following acute overdose. Salicylate is also produced as a result of exposure to bismuth subsalicylate, methyl salicylate, and sodium salicylate.\n\nInteractions \nAspirin is known to interact with other drugs. For example, acetazolamide and ammonium chloride are known to enhance the intoxicating effect of salicylates, and alcohol also increases the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with these types of drugs. Aspirin is known to displace a number of drugs from protein-binding sites in the blood, including the antidiabetic drugs tolbutamide and chlorpropamide, warfarin, methotrexate, phenytoin, probenecid, valproic acid (as well as interfering with beta oxidation, an important part of valproate metabolism), and other NSAIDs. Corticosteroids may also reduce the concentration of aspirin. Other NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, may reduce the antiplatelet effect of aspirin. Although limited evidence suggests this may not result in a reduced cardioprotective effect of aspirin. Analgesic doses of aspirin decrease sodium loss induced by spironolactone in the urine, however this does not reduce the antihypertensive effects of spironolactone. Furthermore, antiplatelet doses of aspirin are deemed too small to produce an interaction with spironolactone. Aspirin is known to compete with penicillin G for renal tubular secretion. Aspirin may also inhibit the absorption of vitamin C.\n\nResearch\nThe ISIS-2 trial demonstrated that aspirin at doses of 160mg daily for one month, decreased the mortality by 21% of participants with a suspected myocardial infarction in the first five weeks. A single daily dose of 324mg of aspirin for 12 weeks has a highly protective effect against acute myocardial infarction and death in men with unstable angina.\n\nBipolar disorder \nAspirin has been repurposed as an add-on treatment for depressive episodes in subjects with bipolar disorder. However, meta-analytic evidence is based on very few studies and does not suggest any efficacy of aspirin in the treatment of bipolar depression. Thus, notwithstanding the biological rationale, the clinical perspectives of aspirin and anti-inflammatory agents in the treatment of bipolar depression remain uncertain.\n\nInfectious diseases\nSeveral studies investigated the anti-infective properties of aspirin for bacterial, viral and parasitic infections. Aspirin was demonstrated to limit platelet activation induced by Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis and to reduce streptococcal adhesion to heart valves. In patients with tuberculous meningitis, the addition of aspirin reduced the risk of new cerebral infarction [RR = 0.52 (0.29-0.92)]. A role of aspirin on bacterial and fungal biofilm is also being supported by growing evidence.\n\nCancer prevention\n\nEvidence from observational studies were conflicting on the effect of aspirin in breast cancer prevention, a randomized controlled trial showed that aspirin had no significant effect in reducing breast cancer  thus further studies are needed to clarify aspirin effect in cancer prevention.\n\nIn gardening \nThere are a many anecdotal reportings that aspirin can improve plant's growth and resistance though most research involved salicylic acid instead of aspirin.\n\nVeterinary medicine \n\nAspirin is sometimes used in veterinary medicine as an anticoagulant or to relieve pain associated with musculoskeletal inflammation or osteoarthritis. Aspirin should only be given to animals under the direct supervision of a veterinarian, as adverse effects—including gastrointestinal issues—are common. An aspirin overdose in any species may result in salicylate poisoning, characterized by hemorrhaging, seizures, coma, and even death.\n\nDogs are better able to tolerate aspirin than cats are. Cats metabolize aspirin slowly because they lack the glucuronide conjugates that aid in the excretion of aspirin, making it potentially toxic if dosing is not spaced out properly. No clinical signs of toxicosis occurred when cats were given 25mg/kg of aspirin every 48 hours for 4 weeks, but the recommended dose for relief of pain and fever and for treating blood clotting diseases in cats is 10mg/kg every 48 hours to allow for metabolization.\n\nSee also\n\nFluoroaspirin\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links \n\n \n \n\n \n1897 in Germany\n1897 in science\nAcetate esters\nAcetylsalicylic acids\nAntiplatelet drugs\nBayer brands\nBrands that became generic\nChemical substances for emergency medicine\nCommercialization of traditional medicines\nCovalent inhibitors\nEquine medications\nGerman inventions\nHepatotoxins\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\nSalicylic acids\nSalicylyl esters\nWorld Health Organization essential medicines\nWikipedia medicine articles ready to translate", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin"}
{"text": "Something for Everyone: A Solstice, Monday Night!\nAt 04:48 UTC Tuesday morning (or 23:48 Monday night Eastern U.S. time), the Earth’s north polar axis will be tipped as far away from the Sun as it will be all year. This means the Sun will reach its most southern position on the sky. It also means we have the day with the least amount of daylight in it,* and the longest night.\nIn other words, it’s the winter solstice (or, out of respect for southern hemisphereans, the December solstice).\nI described this in some detail last year at this time, so if you want more info, check that out.\nBut, there’s something I want to note: You’d think that if the amount of daylight is shortest on the solstice, then you’d have the latest sunrise and earliest sunset, right? But actually, it’s a bit more complicated than that.\nFor example, in Boulder, Colorado, the earliest sunset already happened, sometime around Dec. 8 or so, when it set at 4:36 p.m. But the latest sunrise still hasn’t happened yet: That’ll be around Jan. 4 of next year.\nThis is true everywhere in the Northern Hemisphere, though the exact numbers and dates depend on your latitude. But it’s caused by two things: The Earth’s axis is tilted, and the Earth’s orbit isn’t a perfect circle. These two situations interact in an unusual and not necessarily intuitive way, changing the dates of the latest sunrise and earliest sunset by a week or so around the December solstice. I wrote a post describing it a while back, and if you want even more details, go to analemma.com and poke around; that’s a fun website (if you’re an astronomy dork, as—duh—I am).\nAs it happens, in Boulder on the solstice, it turns out daylight lasts about 9 hours and 20 minutes Monday. Compare that with the summer (June) solstice when daylight is more than 15 hours! That might seem a little bleak, but think of it this way: Every day, from now until June 20 (the summer/June solstice) the days get a bit longer, and night a bit shorter (get the times for your own location here). That’s why ancient peoples celebrated this day; it meant the worst (as far as least daylight) was behind them.\nThat sounds like a fine basis for celebration to me! Even though I’m an astronomer, and I like long nights, it’s nice to see the Sun sometimes too.\nUpdate, Dec. 21, 2015 at 17:20 UTC: Don't forget the real reason for the season!\nCorrection, Dec. 21, at 20:00 UTC: I originally wrote that the solstice was at 21:48 Eastern time, but that's when it is in Mountain time (my own time zone). My apologies to anyone planning any celebrations at the exact moment of the Sun's most southern declination.\n*Some people say we have the shortest day, but that word is ambiguous; do they mean amount of daylight or the time it takes the Earth to spin once? That’s why I phrased it as I did above. Also? One day-night cycle has the technical name of nycthemeron, a word I love.", "url": "https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/something-everyone-solstice-monday-night"}

{"text": "Boehm: Bruce Arena shows he's the man for the big game in key USA win\n\nORLANDO, Fla. – This is just a hasty, back-of-the-napkin calculation, so don’t take it as statistical gospel.\nBut by my approximate count, going all the way back to his University of Virginia days and including his long career in MLS and the US national team, Friday’s World Cup qualifier vs. Panama was the 1,020th high-level soccer game that Bruce Arena has head-coached.\nPeople often toss around phrases like “I’ve done this a thousand times,” but in Arena’s case, he really has seen just about everything in his three-plus decades on the sidelines. So as the USMNT gathered in central Florida this week, their World Cup hopes hanging in the balance as fans and the media fretted and probed, the players could look to their grizzled, wisecracking leader and know that he’s been there, done that.\n“He prepares his teams well for whatever situation that we’re in,” defender Matt Besler said of Arena postgame. “He did a great job of motivating us and preparing us the right way. Then at the end of the day it’s in our hands. He gives this team confidence and he has an experience about him, the way that he goes about things, because he’s been in these positions before. And that carries over to his teams.”\nAnd when the opening whistle blew at Orlando City Stadium, all the careful planning and intense preparation clicked, unleashing a vicious storm of attacking soccer that left Panama bruised, breathless and humiliated, to the tune of a 4-0 rout.\n“In all my years with the national team, this is probably the most prepared I think the team has been, in terms of the work that the coaching staff put in,” said Jozy Altidore, who scored two goals and set up a third. “It’s a huge, huge A+ to them.\n“From Sunday, since the guys landed, they were showing video, pulling guys aside, making sure we were prepared for this game. They made us understand how important the game was to them. Kudos to Bruce and his team for preparing everybody.”\nDetails matter at this level. And though Arena makes a good show of dismissing the game’s complexities with his wry smile and smart-aleck demeanor, he’s shown time and again that he can master them, and deploy them to help his teams win.\nOn paper, the USMNT started in a 4-4-2 (or 4-1-3-2 if you’re being pedantic) that many – this correspondent included – were quick to depict as more of the same for a squad whose recent performances seemed to suggest they needed something much more dramatic. There was even a whiff of recklessness, perhaps overconfidence, in a setup that piled a great deal of responsibility on Michael Bradley, the sole defensive midfielder behind five attack-minded colleagues.\n“I think we’ve played some of our best games like that,” said goalkeeper Tim Howard. “Michael is as honest and hard-working as they come. The guys who played in alongside of him were asked to do two jobs: spring the attack, get in off the shoulder, and then also protect the fullbacks. So tough job for Darlington [Nagbe] and Paul [Arriola], but they did it well tonight.”\nAs it turned out, the home side weren’t leaving their backsides exposed so much as baring their teeth – and their guests were quickly devoured, falling behind 2-0 before 20 minutes had elapsed.\n“They smelled blood from the beginning,” Howard said of Altidore, his strike partner Bobby Wood and Christian Pulisic, deployed underneath them as a classic No. 10. “Any time they picked up the ball it was either a yellow-card foul or some sort of breakaway. They clearly recognized that from the beginning. We spoke about being aggressive, not just ‘being up against them and kicking them’ aggressive, but getting the ball, playing forward, putting them on their heels. We stuck to the game plan – it was good.”\nThe USMNT had spoken repeatedly of the importance of scoring first in the lead-up to this game, which is easy to say. But Arena set up a starting 11 that made that easy for his players to achieve, too. When Panama got up off the canvas and began to mount a response, Arena had a plan for that, too.\n“Yes, it was,” he said postgame when asked if he considered his team’s tactics and shape a gamble. “We wanted to push five players forward into the attack as aggressively as we could. The way Panama plays, we could afford to do that.\n“They made a change when they took [Edgar Yoel] Barcenas out [in the first half] and they went to some version of a 4-2-1-3, maybe, and put a little bit more pressure on Michael, had three players in the central part of the midfield. That’s why we brought Dax [McCarty] in, to play next to Michael, give him a little bit more help.”\nWhile their fans were fretting, the US were building the tools for victory, secure in the knowledge that their boss had a solid plan for success in a big moment, in front of an appreciative, partisan crowd.\nTurns out, he did.\n“Everybody was relaxed,” said Altidore. “We knew we were coming to a place where we were going to have heavy support, as we did here tonight, and we knew we just had to make sure we were the protagonist tonight, and put them under pressure from the first minute, and we did that.”", "url": "https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2017/10/07/boehm-bruce-arena-shows-hes-man-big-game-key-usa-win"}
{"text": "American college student lands in Ohio in coma after release by North Korea\n\nPYONGYANG, North Korea (CNN) -- American college student Otto Warmbier has landed back in the United States after more than 17 months in detention in North Korea.\nWarmbier has been in a coma for over a year, according to his parents, and will be rushed to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center late Tuesday, a hospital spokeswoman said.\nHis return to the US comes as questions swirl about his health and what happened to him while he was detained by the North Korean government. The 22-year-old contracted botulism last year and is in \"bad shape,\" a source close to the family told CNN. North Korea told a US official that Warmbier contracted botulism and slipped into the coma after taking a sleeping pill, a senior State Department official told CNN.\n\"Otto has left North Korea. He is on Medivac flight on his way home. Sadly, he is in a coma and we have been told he has been in that condition since March of 2016. We learned of this only one week ago,\" said Fred and Cindy Warmbier in a statement.\n\"We want the world to know how we and our son have been brutalized and terrorized by the pariah regime in North Korean. We are so grateful that he will finally be with people who love him.\"\nWarmbier was detained in January 2016 at the airport in Pyongyang while on his way home. His parents say the University of Virginia student had been on a tour of the reclusive country.\nNorth Korean authorities said they had security footage of him trying to steal a banner containing a political slogan that was hanging from the walls of his Pyongyang hotel.\nThat was used as evidence in his hour-long trial, during which North Korea accused him of committing \"hostile acts\" against the regime at the urging of a purported member of a church in his home state of Ohio, a secretive university organization and the CIA.\nWarmbier was found guilty and sentenced in March 2016 to 15 years hard labor. It was the last time he was seen publicly.\nNorth Korea: Warmbier contracted botulism\nWarmbier was one of four Americans detained in North Korea.\nSince last March, the US had been pressing North Korea to let Swedish officials see the four Americans, the senior State Department official told CNN. When the Swedes finally got the okay to visit, the North Koreans immediately asked for a meeting with Joe Yun, the US envoy in New York, when he was told about Otto Warmbier's condition.\nIn that meeting about a week ago, Yun was told that Warmbier had contracted botulism a year ago and went into a coma after taking a sleeping pill. US officials then urged those with the ability to persuade Pyongyang to ratchet up the pressure to get him released, said a source, who is familiar with the government's efforts.\nA second senior State Department official said the US has not yet accepted the North Korean version of events in terms of the timing and cause of how Warmbier fell into a coma.\n\"All we know so far is what they have told us,\" the official said. \"This is the North Korean version of events. We won't know anything for sure until doctors are able to fully evaluate Otto's condition.\"\nThree other Americans\nTwo of the three other Americans being held in North Korea, Kim Sang Duk and Kim Hak-song, are academics who worked at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology. The third is a businessman named Kim Dong Chul.\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson said the United States is discussing their respective cases with the North Korean regime. The United States does not have a diplomatic mission in North Korea. \"It's a delicate matter, he said. We're working on it.\"\nBut their fates have been hanging in the balance as Pyongyang and Washington have seen relations get testier in recent months.\nNorth Korea has fired 16 missiles in 10 tests this year. Experts say each launch gets the country closer to its stated goal of developing a nuclear-armed weapon capable of reaching the United States.\nNorth Korea believes its missile program is the only way to deter Washington from trying to overthrow the regime of Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un.\nNo connection to Rodman visit\n\"Otto's detainment and sentence was unnecessary and appalling, and North Korea should be universally condemned for its abhorrent behavior. Otto should have been released from the start,\" said US Sen. Rob Portman, who represents Warmbier's home state of Ohio. \"Fred, Cindy, and the Warmbier family have been remarkably strong throughout this ordeal. Over the last 18 months, they have had to endure more than any family should have to bear.\"\nThe news of Warmbier's release comes the same day as basketball star Dennis Rodman arrived in Pyongyang for an expected four-night visit. But there is no connection between the two events, US National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton said.\nRodman isn't representing the US government or serving as President Donald Trump's emissary, Anton said.\nWhen asked if he would bring up the cases of Warmbier and three other Americans detained in North Korea, Rodman told reporters, \"that's not my purpose right now ... My purpose is to go over there and try to see if I can keep bringing sports to North Korea.\"\nRodman had nothing to do with the student's release, said the source familiar with the government's efforts to free Warmbier.\n'We've needed to talk about Otto'\nWarmbier appeared emotional at a news conference organized by the North Koreans before his trial in March 2016.\nHe tearfully confessed to being \"lured by the United States administration to commit a crime in this country.\"\nIt's not clear if he was forced to speak by the North Koreans.\nHis case largely stayed quiet after that until May of this year, when his parents decided it was time to speak out.\nWhen they spoke to CNN on May 3, they said they had not seen or heard from Otto since his supposed confession.\n\"With tensions as high as they are, we felt that we needed to talk about Otto and put a face on the person,\" Cindy Warmbier said.\nDespite the increasingly hostile US-North Korean relationship, the Warmbiers said they were encouraged by US President Donald Trump's willingness to improve relations with North Korea.\n'I'm excited for him to be back'\nEmmett Saulnier, Warmbier's former college roommate, said he got a brief phone call from Warmbier's father early Tuesday to let him know the younger Warmbier was coming home, and he had been in a coma since last March. Saulnier immediately called some of their closest friends.\nSaulnier and Warmbier met the summer before their freshman year at Virginia. The two bonded over their Ohio roots, and later lived together their junior year, when Warmbier was detained, Saulnier said. The pair had signed a lease to live together again this past school year, their senior year.\n\"It's just been so long that he's been there that to hear he is actually coming home was incredible,\" Saulnier told CNN in a text message.\nSaulnier said: \"I'm excited for him to be back.\"", "url": "http://www.10news.com/news/national/american-college-student-lands-in-ohio-in-coma-after-release-by-north-korea"}

He venido a Lubumbashi para trabajar en la Delegación en temas de proyectos y otros asuntos, y ayer aproveché y salí a buscar un aparato para un tema de energía solar. Después de dar muchas vueltas, entré en la tienda de un comerciante indio. Le costaba el francés y el suahili, así es que se puso feliz de ver que podíamos hablar en inglés. Fue muy bonito porque de pronto se me quedó mirando, y me preguntó si yo era una monja cristiana. Le dije que sí. Él me dijo que era de la India, cristiano también. Es muy bello experimentar esa comunión en Jesús que sobrepasa toda raza, lengua, pueblo y nación.\nMe impresionó que, al hablar de los recientes acontecimientos sucedidos en Lahore (Pakistán) casi se le saltaban las lágrimas… era imposible no acordarse de Gandhi cuando, en los albores de la independencia de ese gran país, prefería ceder la presidencia a que la India se dividiera en dos, como efectivamente sucedió. Impresiona el sufrimiento de la minoría cristiana en Pakhistan… imposible no acordarse del primer ministro Bhatti, que sólo quería “un lugar al pie de la cruz” y que fue asesinado en 2011 por defender los derechos de esas minorías.\nPor otra parte, os recomiendo un precioso libro titulado DIOS O NADA, del Card. Robert Sarah, de la Ed. Palabra.

{"text": "American Cancer Society recommends earlier colorectal cancer screening\n\nBy Ankur Banerjee\n(Reuters) - The American Cancer Society on Wednesday recommended that people at average risk of colorectal cancer start regular screening at the age of 45 rather than at 50, at a time when studies show a rise in cases of the disease among younger individuals.\nThe new ACS guideline https://www.cancer.org/cancer/colon-rectal-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/acs-recommendations.html also recommends people, who are in good health and with a life expectancy of more than 10 years, should continue regular colorectal cancer screening through the age of 75.\nThe guideline suggests screening either through a high sensitivity stool-based test or visual examination such as colonoscopy that snakes a tiny camera through the rectum to view the colon to search for abnormal tissue growth.\nShares of diagnostic company Exact Sciences Corp, which makes Cologuard devices that helps detect colorectal cancer, jumped more than 10 percent after the guideline was revealed.\nThe move comes as a study https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21457 showed that there has been a marked increase in colorectal cancer incidence, particularly rectal cancer, among younger individuals.\n\"While we commend the ACS for its forward thinking ... we do not believe this will necessarily be a big driver of Cologuard volume upside for Exact Sciences in the near term,\" William Blair analyst Brian Weinstein said.\nWeinstein noted that Cologuard is currently approved for colon cancer screening for people between the ages of 50 and 84, adding that the company would need to run a separate trial for lower age groups.\nExact Sciences Chief Executive Officer Kevin Conroy said Cologuard is a cheaper way to screen younger people.\n\"First we need to do clinical work to establish the safety and efficacy of Cologuard in that population,\" Conroy told Reuters.\nColorectal cancer is the third-leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men and women in the United States and is expected to cause about 50,630 deaths during 2018.\nAmerican Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, a non-partisan advocacy affiliate of ACS, said it intends to officially recommend reconsideration of a guideline from U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).\nCurrently, USPSTF, a government-backed independent panel that assesses the evidence for medical procedures, recommends screening from the age of 50.\nUSPSTF's 2016 recommendation was based on a review of the available evidence on benefits and harms of colorectal cancer screening, USPSTF Chairwoman Sue Curry said.\n\"At the time of the Task Force's review, there was limited data on screening adults younger than age 50.\"\n(Reporting by Ankur Banerjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/american-cancer-society-recommends-earlier-colorectal-cancer-screening-173152305--finance.html"}

Dezember 1982 in Koblenz-Lay) ist ein deutscher Florettfechter.\nSeine bisher größten Erfolge hatte er 2003, 2006, 2007 und 2010 als Einzel-Weltmeister. Er nahm 2004 an den Olympischen Spielen in Athen teil und belegte den sechsten Platz, 2008 bei den Spielen in Peking den fünften Platz. Mit der Mannschaft gewann er im Herrenflorett bei den Olympischen Spielen 2012 Bronze.\nPeter Joppich ist von Beruf Sportsoldat der Bundeswehr. Erste Erfolge im Fechten sammelte er bereits als B-Jugendlicher. Von 1997 bis 2001 war er Schüler des Bonner Fechtinternates. Seit seiner Juniorzeit 1999 war er immer in der Weltspitze vertreten. Bis 2007 startete er für den Königsbacher SC Koblenz, seither für die Coblenzer Turngesellschaft 1880. Er trainiert im Olympiastützpunkt in Bonn bei seinem Heim- und Bundestrainer Ulrich Schreck.\nEr wurde 2003 in Havanna zum ersten Mal Einzel-Weltmeister im Herrenflorett. 2002 ist ihm dies schon mit der Mannschaft gelungen. In Lissabon wurde er mit der deutschen Nationalmannschaft Weltmeister. 2006 konnte er in Turin seinen zweiten Einzel-Weltmeistertitel feiern, 2007 in Sankt Petersburg den dritten. Seinen vierten und vorläufig letzten Einzel-Weltmeistertitel gewann er 2010 in Paris. Bei der Europameisterschaft 2007 in Gent holte er mit der Herrenflorettmannschaft den Titel. In den Jahren 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007 und 2013 wurde er Deutscher Einzel-Meister im Herrenflorett.\nWährend er bei den Olympischen Spielen 2012 im Einzel schon im Achtelfinale gegen den Afrikameister Alaaeldin Abouelkassem ausschied,[1] konnte er anschließend mit der Mannschaft im Herrenflorett einige nervenstarke Kämpfe zeigen. Sowohl im Viertel- als auch im Halbfinale gelang es ihm als letztem Fechter, in seinem dreiminütigen Gefecht einen deutlichen Rückstand für Deutschland aufzuholen. Jedoch verlor Deutschland im Halbfinale gegen Japan in der Verlängerung mit 41:40 nach einer umstrittenen Kampfrichterentscheidung.[2] Bei dem anschließenden Gefecht um Bronze hatte die deutsche Mannschaft mit Joppich gegen die Vereinigten Staaten wenig Mühe und gewann deutlich.[3]\nLandessportler des Jahres (Rheinland-Pfalz): 2003, 2006, 2007, 2008 und 2009\nCommons: Peter Joppich – Sammlung von Bildern, Videos und Audiodateien\nWebsite Peter Joppich\nAthleten-Biographie – Peter Joppich auf der Website des Deutschen Fechterbundes\nPeter JOPPICH – Rankings and Results in der Datenbank der Fédération Internationale d’Escrime (englisch/französisch)\nPeter Joppich auf Sports-Reference.com (englisch)\n↑ Olaf Wolf: Kurzes Intermezzo in London.

{"text": "How long does it take the flu to evade a vaccine?\nWith all the recent Presidential attention to the threat from the H5N1 Avian Flu, and the many billions now earmarked for stockpiling vaccines and drugs, it seems like a good idea to ask on what time scale the virus might be able to evade these countermeasures. Vaccination is of particular interest, as it is regarded as by far the best tool to combat viral infection at the population level.\nGenomic analyses of H5N1 isolates from birds and humans showed 2 distinct clades with a nonoverlapping geographic distribution. All the viral genes were of avian influenza origin, which indicates absence of reassortment with human influenza viruses.\nGenetic and antigenic analyses have shown that, compared to previous H5N1 isolates, 2004-2005 isolates share several amino acid changes that modulate antigenicity and perhaps other biological function. Furthermore, our molecular analysis of the HA from isolates collected in 2005 suggests that several amino acids located near the receptor-binding site are undergoing change, some of which may affect antigenicity or transmisibility.\nDespite the recent \"Isolation of drug-resistant H5N1 virus,\" (Nature, 20 October 2005), the WHO Global Influenza team determined that recent isolates are \"sensitive to 2 neuraminidase inhibitors that are recommended for prophylactic or therapeutic intervention against human infections.\" So obviously the specific details of which viral isolate one is working with determine its sensitivity to drugs. In the case of the drug-resistant strain, it was isolated in February 2005 from a Vietnamese girl who may have contracted the virus while she cared for her brother. Human-to-human transmission is supported by the girl's lack of contact with poultry and the fact that the neuraminidase gene from virus isolated from the girl was virtually identical to that isolated from her brother. Thus there are evidently drug resistant strains running around in the wild.\nAs far as I can tell, it just isn't yet clear how fast drug-resistance traits can spread. There is now at least a little data about how long it takes a particular viral strain to find work-arounds for vaccines. A recent initial effort to sequence many flu strains in parallel indicates that mutations that provide ways around vaccines can rapidly dominate a population of flu viruses.\nPerhaps the most dramatic finding in our data is the discovery of an epidemiologically significant reassortment that explains the appearance, during the 2003-2004 season, of the 'Fujian/411/2002'-like strain, for which the existing vaccine had limited effectiveness. ...Phylogenetic analysis of 156 H3N2 genomes from our project revealed the clear presence of multiple, distinct clades circulating in the population. Through a reassortment event, a minor clade provided the haemagglutinin gene that later became part of the dominant strain after the 2002-2003 season.\nThis finding illustrates not only that the influenza virus population contains multiple lineages at any given time, but also that alternate, minor lineages can contribute genetic variation to the dominant lineage, resulting in epidemiologically significant, antigenically novel strains. It is worth emphasizing that our sequence-based sampling approach--in contrast to traditional serologically based sampling--will reveal co-circulating strains even before they become antigenically novel.\nIn other words, the authors assert that amongst viruses that we give the same name there is considerable variation that may be hard to distinguish using traditional techniques. Sequencing the genomes of many isolates can provide a map of how a population of viruses is changing in response to vaccines. Ghedin, et al., note that their work demonstrates significant change of the dominant flu strain even within the 2003-2004 flu season. That variation appeared to originate and then dominate the population of viruses within 12 months.\nWhich brings me to the core of this post, namely that we now have real-world data demonstrating that flu viruses can escape vaccines in less than a year, far shorter than the time it takes to produce significant quantities of effective vaccines. It is important to note that this is a different problem than producing a new vaccine for new annual flu strains every year. If a pandemic strain emerges, our problem is not planning ahead just far enough to deploy a vaccine for next year's strain, but rather to combat a strain already killing people worldwide. It took most of a year for the CDC and Sanofi to come up with a hypothetical H5N1 vaccine, and the new National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza contains the expectation of years to accumulate enough vaccine to be useful for large populations. Never mind that the existing whole virus vaccine may not be effective against a pandemic strain.\nThe fact that the minor Fujian-like clade has donated its HA to the previously dominant strain rather than itself becoming the dominant circulating virus indicates that there may be important amino acid co-substitutions in the other proteins essential for viral fitness.\n...Even within a geographically constrained set of isolates, we have found surprising genetic diversity, indicating that the reservoir of influenza A strains in the human population -- and the concomitant potential for segment exchange between strains -- may be greater than was previously suspected.\nWe cannot think of the H5N1, or any other strain, as either a clonal population experiencing selection or as a bunch of individuals producing descendants that may accumulate mutations leading to a pandemic strain. Rather, flu viruses exists as elements of a population that appear to be constantly innovating and trading parts. This is a critical distinction, particularly in light of rapid human and avian intercontinental travel. Not only have we now learned that there is greater variation in any given set of geographically linked isolates, but because of human travel we can expect all kinds of novel parts to show up in populations that were otherwise isolated and appeared to be of no immediate threat.\nThe Ghedin paper doesn't necessarily teach us directly about the evolution of pandemic flu strains, but it does suggest our current plan for pandemic vaccination is not well suited for the problem at hand.\nAfter studying synthetic vaccines for Bio-ERA, amongst other clients, I think DNA vaccines are the best bet for rapid response on a time scale shorter than flu strains seem to evolve. I've a draft paper on synthetic vaccines in for consideration at Biosecurity and Bioterrorism, and will shortly embark on another paper specifically about distributed manufacture of DNA vaccines. PowderMed is waiting for publication of their (already accepted) first paper on their plasmid vaccine for the annual flu and will be starting trials of an H5N1 DNA vaccine early next year. Unfortunately, it seems the folks in DC aren't taking this technology seriously, and instead blowing billions on developing cell culture production of whole virus vaccines. Even the folks who manufacture vaccines in cell culture acknowledge this will only cut a month or two off the response time.", "url": "http://www.synthesis.cc/synthesis/2005/11/how_long_does_it_take_the_flu_to_evade_a_vaccine"}

{"text": "Students pay almost £400k in library fines\n\nuniversities in Leeds have made almost £400,000 from fining students for overdue library books in the past three years.\nLeeds University accrued the most money from overdue books, collecting more than £211,000 in fines since the 2014/2015 academic year.\nLeeds Beckett, which collected £147,509, was the second highest, while Leeds Trinity University was third with fines totalling £27,682\nA spokesperson for the University of Leeds said: “The university has five libraries and nearly 33,000 students, so our size is a factor in any comparison of library fines, and all fines are invested back into our libraries.”\nWith fines as little as 10p a day for each day a book is overdue, it shows that students are returning thousands of books late each year.\nThe universities say that all the fines are ploughed back into library services, with money spent on resources, including books and journals, “that it is benefited directly by the student”.\nA spokesperson for Leeds Beckett University said: “Fines are used as a strategy to ensure the prompt return of books and to maximise book availability for all students in a context of sharing resources. Staff are also charged fines at the same level.\n“Students generally support the use of fines to encourage their fellow students to bring back books promptly so they all get a chance to use them.”\nStudents at the University of Leeds only start incurring fines if the borrowed book has been requested by someone else, and they must then fork out £2.50 per day if the item is overdue.\nA Leeds University Union spokesperson said: “The cost of student living is an ongoing conversation between us and the university. We will continue to work with the libraries to ensure that students are kept well informed on policies and procedures that may lead to fines and that these are fair and transparent.”", "url": "http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/education/students-pay-almost-400k-in-library-fines-1-8497030"}
{"text": "﻿ Immobiliengutachter in Steenodde - BSV-Express - Bausachverständigenbüro für Immobiliengutachten\nDaniela Gutsche, Immobiliengutachterin in Steenodde\nAufgaben und Tätigkeitsbereiche eines Immobiliengutachters in Steenodde im Überblick\nDer Immobiliengutachter erstellt im Rahmen seiner Leistungen entsprechende Wertgutachten für Immobilien in Steenodde – meist handelt es sich dabei um so genannte Verkehrswertgutachten, die den Verkehrswert der etwaigen Immobilie aufzeigen.\nNicht nur der tatsächliche Wert der Immobilie kann mittels Immobiliengutachten genau erfasst werden, sondern auch der bauliche Zustand. Denn ein Immobiliengutachten deckt überdies auch ausstehende Modernisierungsmaßnahmen sowie versäumte Instandsetzungsmaßnahmen auf. Außerdem kann ein Immobiliengutachter in Steenodde auch den energetischen Zustand der Immobilie genauestens bewerten und ebenfalls im Immobiliengutachten festhalten.\nWann Sie als Immobilienbesitzer in Steenodde ein entsprechendes Immobiliengutachten benötigen\nWeiterhin kann ein Immobiliengutachten in Steenodde aber auch in der Situation einer Zwangsversteigerung von Nöten sein – damit wird der genaue Wert der Immobilie ermittelt, um den späteren Erlös an die potentiellen Gläubiger des Schuldners besser einschätzen zu können.\nAuch auf Grundlage von Erbschaft oder Schenkung sowie von Veräußerung von Immobilien in Steenodde interessiert sich vor allem das Finanzamt im Rahmen der Festlegung von Spekulations-, Schenkungs- und Erbschaftssteuer für den tatsächlichen Wert einer Immobilie, welcher in einem Immobiliengutachten bescheinigt wird.\nAuf Basis dieser Grundlagen erstellt ein Immobiliengutachter in Steenodde ein Immobiliengutachten\nWeiterhin relevant für ein Immobiliengutachten ist aber auch der Bodenrichtwert der Immobilie in Steenodde. Hierbei handelt es sich um den Wert pro Quadratmeter unbebauten Boden, auf dem die Immobilie errichtet wurde.\nAußerdem ein wichtiger Punkt, der in ein Immobiliengutachten mit einfließt, ist die Lage der Immobilie in Steenodde. Dabei geht es um potentielle Verkehrsanbindungen oder Einkaufsmöglichkeiten, die sich in unmittelbarer Nähe zur Immobilie befinden und damit deren Wohnqualität steigern.\nÜber den Erschließungsgrad der Immobilie erfährt der Immobiliengutachter in Steenodde zudem, inwieweit das Objekt an das etwaige Wassersystem oder Telefonnetz angeschlossen ist. Für potentielle Immobilienkäufer dürfte darüber hinaus von äußerster Wichtigkeit sein, ob und in welchem Umfang Altlasten auf dem Grundstück oder dem Gebäude bestehen (z.B. Asbestbedachung), auf dessen Beseitigungskosten der Neubesitzer im schlimmsten Fall sitzen bleiben kann. Zu guter Letzt spielt natürlich auch die aktuelle Marktlage in Steenodde bei der Berechnung des Immobilienwertes eine große Rolle.\nDie Kosten für ein Immobiliengutachten in Steenodde, welches von einem Immobiliengutachter erstellt wird, können teilweise recht massiv schwanken und sind vor allem von der Art und dem Umfang der zu bewertenden Immobile abhängig. Das Bausachverständigenbüro Daniela Gutsche garantiert Ihnen dagegen eine kompetente Immobilienbewertung und Wertgutachten zum günstigen Festpreis.\nIn jedem Fall lohnt sich die Investition in ein Wertgutachten durch einen Immobiliengutachter in Steenodde für den jeweiligen Immobilienkäufer, da diese unter Umständen Unwägbarkeiten in Bezug auf den bevorstehenden Immobilienkauf aufdecken kann (z.B. Baualtlasten, Mängel an der Bausubstanz, Mietrückstände bei den Mietern), die sich der Kaufinteressent bei der Preisverhandlung für die Immobilie durchaus zunutze machen sollte. Außerdem kann die Kenntnis über den genauen Wert der Immobilie im Erbschafts- oder Scheidungsfall auch konkrete Auskünfte über die Höhe der Auszahlungen für einen Ehepartner oder Erbenden geben.\nGerne erstelle ich Ihnen ein Angebot für eine Immobilienbesichtigung und ein Wertgutachten mit Angabe des Verkehrswerts zu Ihrer Immobilie in Steenodde, oder auch zur Wunsch-Immobilie, die Sie dort erwerben möchten.", "url": "https://bsv-express.de/Immobiliengutachter-Schleswig-Holstein/Steenodde/"}

{"text": "This leaflet was published in March of 2010 by Planodio Steki Dromou Planodio Steki Dromou (Πλανόδιο Στέκι Δρόμου) in Lefkosia.\nWe create relationships through Facebook, we play games with a joystick, we pass endless afternoons in classrooms, and at night we sink tired in the couch to watch television. We go to school and afternoon classes for a future position in university. We go to university for a good future job that will guarantee us a good wage. We work for so many years to afford the “perfect” house and the “perfect” car, and then we work for the same amount of years to afford a second house in the country and get away from the “perfect” house we previously bought!\nLet’s just think for a moment of the consequences of this modern way of life. Endless hours in the traffic, time divided into work and consuming (malls, cafés, clubs, football), the restriction of the “institution” of the neighborhood and the continuous destruction of the environment.\nWhat does really separate us from loneliness and alienation? Only when the last tree has died and the last river been poisoned and the last fish been caught will we realize we cannot eat money?\n–> Let’s fight the devitalization of our time with our imagination and creativeness. Let’s transport the idea of gaming from the video consoles to the streets and fields. Let’s bring sports from the television channels to our neighborhoods.\n–> Streets are not only for shopping malls and politicians’ huge advertisements. Let’s all walk down in the Streets, in the Neighborhoods, in the Parks and the Squares to build our lives as we want them to be. We should introduce ideas like solidarity and open assemblies in every neighborhood with the aim of taking decisions in our hands. Let’s stop waiting from the “responsible politicians” to decide for us.\n–> We should be enjoying the joys of knowledge, not of “instructions” and “training”. Knowledge and learning must not be trapped into dead certificates and diplomas, but it should rather be a continuous process of creativeness. We should aim for mutual teaching and learning, outside the limits of competition and exams.\n–> We want to feel the joy of impulsiveness and human communication. Such a communication will not take into account “lifestyle” models and taboos. We want to come close to nature again. We want to have daily contact with her rather than watching “virtual trees” from our computers. Let’s leave our cars for a while, and try riding our bicycles again. Let’s stand on our own feet.\n–> Street art is a continuous, collectivized, interactive process. The artist should not be hierarchically separated from the public. We are against the idolization of the artist and the spiritual sterilization of commercial art. We shall set up our own concerts, our own street theatres and street galleries. All these will be done only with our efforts, away from sponsors and huge profits.\nLet’s set our talents free. Let’s emancipate the artist we hide inside us.", "url": "https://movementsarchive.org/doku.php?id=en:brochures:planodiosteki:planodiosteki_alilegkii"}
